<item>Students will analyze descriptions of documents, speeches, laws, and events from documents related to the Civil War and Reconstruction to evaluate to what extent the promises of the Founding were fulfilled with respect to equality.</item>
<item>Students will analyze a Thomas Nast cartoon to show how various factors, including the principles of federalism and checks and balances, were related to the degree to which African Americans could exercise their inalienable rights by 1876.</item>

<item>Study additional Thomas Nast cartoons and consider how Nast approached the principle of equality and other constitutional principles. See <link class="target-chapter" document="m80621">Cartoon Analysis: Thomas Nast on Reconstruction, 1869‚Äì1874</link> in Chapter 8.</item>
<item>Have students choose a document, speech, or event in their handout and create a political cartoon that reflects the event‚Äôs failure or support of the ability of African Americans to exercise their natural right to equality.</item>
<item>Have students construct a graph that plots the success or failure of the events listed in the timeline on a scale of equality.</item>
<item>In addition to African Americans, American Indians, immigrants, women, and other minorities faced challenges to their enjoyment of natural rights by the end of the nation‚Äôs first century. To explore these topics, students might start by researching the following: the destruction of the bison in westward expansion, the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871, the Know Nothing Party, and Married Women‚Äôs Property Acts.</item>
<item>Explore the application or the lack thereof regarding additional constitutional principles, such as Rule of Law. For example, students might review the timeline to identify events in which Rule of Law was directly violated, listing the rush of settlers to Kansas, Black Codes, race riots, and KKK activities, among other possible responses. They may also point out events that fulfilled the Rule of Law.</item>
<item>At a later date in the course, review this material to explain how federalism, along with checks and balances, have been a means to achieving equality.</item>
