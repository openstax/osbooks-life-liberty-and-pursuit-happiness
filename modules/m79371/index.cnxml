<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm180217056">Westward expansion, and the ensuing conflict with American Indians who called these lands home, was a recurrent theme in colonial and early American history. In the early part of the 1800s, American settlers began pressuring the federal government to remove American Indians occupying the lands the settlers desired. Through military campaigns and treaties, the U.S. government slowly and sporadically began to transfer American Indians from their lands to areas west of the Mississippi River. However, by the time Andrew Jackson was elected president in 1828, thousands of American Indians still lived east of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole tribes (collectively known as the Five Civilized Tribes) made up most of this remaining population. Part of their success in keeping their lands was due to their adoption of some American cultural and political values. Despite their attempts at assimilation, the Five Civilized Tribes ultimately suffered the same fate as other Indian tribes.</para>
<para id="fs-idm211552304">As president, Jackson pushed for a removal policy that would move all remaining American Indians west of the Mississippi. As a result, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830. In 1836, a small Cherokee faction signed the Treaty of New Echota, which ceded all the tribes’ land in exchange for a reservation in modern day Oklahoma. In response, Cherokee chief John Ross submitted his <emphasis effect="italics">Memorial and Protest of the Cherokee Nation</emphasis> to Congress to declare the Treaty of New Echota void.</para>

What good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to our extensive republic, studded with cities, towns, and prosperous farms, embellished with all the improvements which art can devise or industry execute, occupied by more than 12,000,000 happy people, and filled with all the blessings of liberty, civilization, and religion? . . .</quote>
