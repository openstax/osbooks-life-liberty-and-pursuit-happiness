<para id="fs-idm410270400">Virginia‚Äôs English colonists were nervous. Since founding Jamestown in 1607, they had endured cold winters, starvation, war with Indians, and changes in their colonial charter. Now, in 1634, they had a new concern: English Roman Catholics were about to become their neighbors to the north. Remember that in this time, religion and politics were closely related, and since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, for whom the Virginia colony had been named, England had committed itself to Protestantism. Yet in 1632, King Charles I granted a charter to the second Lord Baltimore, Cecil Calvert, to begin a colony in the Chesapeake, right next to Virginia. Cecil and his father, George, had converted to Roman Catholicism in the 1620s.</para>
<para id="fs-idm401224480">All sorts of fears ran through the Virginians‚Äô minds. What if the Catholics coming to the Calvert‚Äôs new colony converted Virginian Protestants to their faith? What if these English Catholics threw off the king‚Äôs authority once they were an ocean away? Worst of all, what if they allied with Florida‚Äôs Spanish Catholics or Canada‚Äôs French Catholics and conquered the entire Atlantic Coast under the banner of Roman Catholicism?</para>
<para id="fs-idm401286192">The Calverts knew these fears could disrupt their plans. In their minds, the colony would be a refuge for English Catholics, who had long been persecuted by their Protestant countrymen. They worried that anti-Catholic anger might keep their colony‚Äînamed Maryland in honor of King Charles‚Äô wife, Queen Henrietta Maria‚Äîfrom succeeding. In an attempt to address Protestant fears, the Calverts published a paper titled ‚ÄúObjections Answered Touching Maryland.‚Äù They insisted that they posed no threat to the Protestant colonies in Virginia and New England. They assured their Protestant countrymen that there was no conspiracy to subvert the English Crown, to ally with the Spanish, or to <term>proselytize</term> their Protestant neighbors. All the Maryland colonists wanted, the Calverts explained, was to worship freely as Catholics and live in peace and harmony with their neighbors (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_02_03_CalvertMD"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm386490752">As it turned out, Maryland‚Äôs founders were in for a disappointment. Relatively few English Catholics made the long trek across the Atlantic. The colony founded to be a refuge for Catholics held greater appeal for Protestant dissenters, such as Quakers and Puritans who disagreed with the Church of England. The Calverts had imagined a Catholic colony but ended up with religious diversity. Maryland‚Äôs real problem was figuring out how its religiously diverse people, a mix of England‚Äôs religious outsiders and members of the Church of England, could live with each other in harmony and order.</para>
<para id="fs-idm393838880">In 1649, Maryland‚Äôs assembly proposed a remedy, passing a landmark bill called the ‚ÄúAct Concerning Religion,‚Äù also referred to as the Maryland Toleration Act or the Toleration Act (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_02_03_MDTolerAct"/>). The act made it illegal for Marylanders to use derogatory religious terms for each other, including ‚Äúheretic, schismatic, idolater ‚Ä¶ popish priest, Jesuited papist ‚Ä¶ or any other name or term in a reproachful manner relating to matters of religion.‚Äù More important, the act decreed all Christians free to worship as they wished, so long as they believed in the Trinity (the existence of God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and in the divinity of Jesus Christ. No Christians would be persecuted for their faith, and none could be forced to attend services of or pay tithes to any other denomination. The Act was truly ground breaking. For the first time in English law, all Christians were promised free exercise of religion. If the colonists had embraced the concept, Maryland would have become the first place in the English-speaking world where Catholics, Protestants, and Christians of all kinds could live together in peace.</para>

<caption>Broadsides were large sheets of paper that were plastered onto walls to display advertisements, political proclamations, and other information. This broadside was circulated in 1649, when Maryland‚Äôs assembly passed the Toleration Act, which decreed that no Christians should be persecuted for their faith.</caption>

<para id="fs-idm390238608">Unfortunately for Maryland‚Äôs Catholics, events back in England frequently disrupted colonial harmony. King Charles I‚Äôs own Catholic leanings, together with his high-handed use of monarchical power, eventually led to the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1645). After Charles‚Äôs defeat and execution for treason in 1649, England was ruled by the Puritan Oliver Cromwell. Under the authority of the English Parliament, Puritans seized control of Maryland. These new overseers, staunch Reformed Protestants, were not friendly toward Catholicism. They immediately repealed the Toleration Act and banned Catholics from openly worshiping.</para>
<para id="fs-idm389397776">After the English monarchy was restored in 1660 by Charles I‚Äôs son, King Charles II, the Toleration Act was reinstated. But tensions between pro-Catholic Englishmen and Reformed Protestants continued. After Charles II‚Äôs death in 1685, his brother James II became king. Britain‚Äôs Protestants, increasingly nervous at James‚Äôs friendliness with France, decided they had had enough of pro-Catholic kings. In 1688, England overthrew James and replaced him with the Dutch Protestant William of Orange, who was married to Mary, the daughter of James. This ‚Äú<term>Glorious Revolution</term>‚Äù affirmed the Protestant character of the English monarchy once and for all. It also allowed simmering anti-Catholic sentiment in England and the North American colonies to boil over (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_02_03_CharlesI"/>).</para>

<caption>Religion and politics were a deadly mix in England and its colonies in the mid to late seventeenth century. The English Civil War saw the execution of the pro-Catholic Charles I outside Whitehall Palace in London. Religious tensions continued during the reigns of the Puritan leader Oliver Cromwell, Charles II (the son of the beheaded King Charles I), and James II (Charles II‚Äôs pro-Catholic brother) until the Glorious Revolution of 1688.</caption>

<para id="fs-idm393935936">In Maryland, resentment against Catholic leaders had been growing for decades. Although the majority of the population was Protestant, Catholics retained control of the <term>proprietary government</term> and reinstated the Toleration Act. At least according to some Protestants, Maryland‚Äôs religious liberty was a farce. Catholics appeared to enjoy all the power and all the wealth. Protestants complained that Catholic officials monopolized political offices, imposed unfair taxes, and lived in luxury while Protestant ministers struggled to make a living. Some non-Catholics whispered that Maryland Catholics had allied with the Seneca Indians for the ‚Äútotal destroying of all the Protestants.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm407333536">When word of James II‚Äôs ouster came across the Atlantic, Protestants in Maryland rejoiced, while Catholics continued to hope that James II might still put down the rebellion. Finally, Protestants acted against the Catholic proprietors. John Coode, an Anglican minister and zealous anti-Catholic, led an armed force against the colonial capital, present-day Annapolis. When the Catholic government tried to rally Marylanders to put down Coode‚Äôs Rebellion, it found few who were willing. Eventually, Lord Baltimore‚Äôs men were forced to surrender on August 1, 1689.</para>
<para id="fs-idm388263744">With a new Protestant governor in place, Marylanders openly passed a wave of repressive, anti-Catholic religious and civil measures. The Toleration Act was revoked again, Catholic worship was banned, and Catholics were barred from voting. The ground-breaking religious freedom that Maryland‚Äôs Catholics had extended to Protestants in 1649 was not enjoyed again until the time of the American Revolution. Eventually, the principle of religious liberty that Maryland first put forward in the Toleration Act was expanded to include non-Christians and was enshrined in U.S. law.</para>
