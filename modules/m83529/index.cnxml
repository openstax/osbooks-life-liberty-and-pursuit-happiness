<para id="fs-idm378305680">The second image in this activity contains racial epithets, caricatures, and stereotypes of African Americans that were common in 1866. It is used to provide contrast to the first image and to develop an understanding of the point of view of those who, at the time, opposed the goals of the Freedmen’s Bureau.

<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm374065376">After emancipation and the conclusion of the Civil War, the Freedmen’s Bureau was created to help integrate formerly enslaved persons into American society. It did so in a variety of ways but with a focus on education and training that aimed to enable African Americans to support themselves and their families and become productive citizens. However, there was opposition to the Bureau, both for the perceived wastefulness of some of its programs as well as hardened opposition to its goals of integrating African Americans. The following images depict two perspectives on the Freedmen’s Bureau.</para>

<media id="fs-idm390453584" alt="The poster shows an enlarged stereotyped caricature of a black man lying back and relaxing. Behind him is the capitol building made of phrases like “Freedom and No Work; White sugar; candy; Uncle Sam will have to keep me.” He says “Whar is de use for me to work as long as dey make dese appropriations.” In front of him, white men plow and split wood. The fence says “The white man must work to keep his children and pay his taxes.” Above the picture reads “The Freedman’s Bureau! An agency to keep the negro in idleness at the expense of the white man. Twice vetoed by the president, and made a law by Congress. Support Congress and you support the negro. Sustain the president and you protect the white man.” Below the picture reads “For 1864 and 1865, the Freedman’s Bureau cost the tax-payers of the Nation, at least twenty-five millions of dollars. For 1866, the share of the tax-payers of Pennsylvania will be about one million of dollars. Geary is for the Freedman’s Bureau. Clymer is opposed to it.”">
