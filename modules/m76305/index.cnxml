<para id="fs-idm254579760">The ninth ruler of the Aztec Empire, Montezuma, was not overly concerned by the report he had just received. For the past few years, his spies had been informing him of the activities of the Spanish and their expeditions. Now, in 1519, a report came to him of another group of foreign men coming from the Yucatan Peninsula and entering the eastern borders of his central Mexican empire. Montezuma resided at a distance from the coast in the capital city of Tenochtitlan, which is today Mexico City. A strong ruler who had aggressively expanded the Aztec Empire to its height, Montezuma weighed his options concerning this new expedition before deciding whether to welcome its leader, Hernando Cort√©s.</para>
<para id="fs-idm281076704">Montezuma led an empire that served its patron <term>deity</term> through the capture and sacrifice of war captives. He was no stranger to warfare and certainly was not intimidated by Cort√©s and his Spanish companions. Like other Native Americans, Montezuma viewed the bearded white Spaniards with curiosity, yet he understood that they were just as mortal as he was, and certainly not gods. That said, he faced not only Cort√©s and his few hundred Spaniards but also thousands of Spain‚Äôs Native American allies, many from Montezuma‚Äôs unbeatable military rival and neighbor, Tlaxcala. Montezuma thus knew the Spaniards could successfully defend themselves in battle. Not only did their steel swords hold a decisive advantage over the <term>obsidian</term> axes and clubs used by the Native Americans of central Mexico but the Spaniards could also garner support from towns at odds with the Aztecs, which might supply them with food and warriors.</para>
<para id="fs-idm259512064">Like many empires, the Aztec culture conquered its neighbors with military might and forced them to pay tribute in labor and goods. Even the capital, Tenochtitlan, was held together by political and military persuasion, which allowed tensions to simmer under the surface. For example, although the city of Tlatelolco was incorporated into Tenochtitlan as a sister city in the fifteenth century, it had been at odds with Tenochtitlan and its rulers long before the Spaniards arrived (its inhabitants later blamed Montezuma for the Aztecs‚Äô defeat). Such division provided Cort√©s with a ready supply of allies willing to throw off the yoke of Aztec oppression.</para>
<para id="fs-idm260368672">Montezuma also considered his duty to his people. When faced with the decision of what to do about Cort√©s, he could jump headfirst into war, certainly. But a lengthy war could affect the planting and harvesting season, which would mean famine for his subjects. So he chose a more pragmatic approach: Montezuma would welcome and entertain the foreigner, impress him with the greatness of the vast capital city, and persuade him to be an ally. If all else failed, Montezuma always had the option of war. For the sake of his people and empire, however, a negotiation with Cort√©s made much more sense.</para>
<para id="fs-idm269661904">Montezuma‚Äôs decision to welcome Cort√©s into his city reflected his strength and intelligence, not his weakness. Years of reports of Spaniards along the coastline suggested they were in the Americas to stay. Even defeating Cort√©s outright would only delay the inevitable negotiations that must be made with the newcomers. Montezuma rightly concluded that it was better to negotiate with the Spaniards on his terms, in his city, from a position of strength. After all, Cort√©s had already shown himself willing to ally with other Native American cities. Surely Montezuma could convince him that he would be the most valuable ally of all and negotiate a deal that would allow him to keep his empire intact and his people safe.</para>
<para id="fs-idm273807968">Thus Montezuma welcomed and entertained the Spaniards for a few months (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH01_04_CortMont"/>). He showed them his temples, the enormous markets where goods from all over his empire were sold, his zoo, and his palaces. Montezuma did not think Cort√©s was the <term>reincarnation</term> of an ancient Aztec deity, as some thought at the time. He was just a powerful rival who could be bent to Montezuma‚Äôs will and interests.</para>

<para id="fs-idm269575440">Some Native Americans from Tlateloloco later encouraged the belief that omens predicting the destruction of his empire, including an eclipse, a comet, and a terrible storm, had frightened Montezuma (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH01_04_MontComet"/>). Yet this was an attempt to show Montezuma as a weak, indecisive, and superstitious leader who was to blame for the fall of Tenochtitlan. Instead, he was strong and decisive, and he knew what he wanted from the Spanish.</para>
<figure id="BRI_APUSH01_04_MontComet" class="full-width">
<media id="fs-idm268759408" alt="An image shows Montezuma standing on a building‚Äôs roof while a large comet is shown overhead.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/BRI_APUSH_01_04_MontComet.jpg"/>
</media>
<caption>Images such as this one, in which Montezuma watches a large comet streak across the sky, perpetuated the belief that Montezuma‚Äôs superstition was to blame for the fall of the Aztec empire.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm275306176">For his part, during his stay in Tenochtitlan, Cort√©s took every opportunity to search for precious metals and convert Montezuma to Christianity. Montezuma also informed Cort√©s of his people‚Äôs worldview and deities, their traditions, and customs. As a good host, he tolerated some of Cort√©s‚Äôs requests and even offered one of his daughters to Cort√©s as a potential wife, in the time-honored fashion of Aztecs building alliances. Yet with his emphasis on precious metals and his foreign religion, Cort√©s began to wear out his welcome.</para>
<para id="fs-idm255325440">Then news from Montezuma‚Äôs spies changed everything. In April 1520, they reported that approximately 800 Spaniards had arrived on the coast with 13 ships. Cort√©s knew at once that the hostile fleet, led by Panfilo de Narvaez, had certainly come from his disgruntled <term>patron</term>, Diego de Vel√°zquez. Cort√©s had betrayed de Vel√°zquez by embarking on this expedition without permission‚Äîan act of insubordination for which he could be imprisoned. With a Spanish fleet approaching, however, Montezuma saw his chance to get rid of his increasingly bothersome guest and prepared his people for war. His decision to welcome Cort√©s had paid off‚ÄîMontezuma had learned all he could of the interlopers and their intentions and now decided to act.</para>
<para id="fs-idm281544048">Aware of his precarious situation, Cort√©s moved first by imprisoning Montezuma; the exact details of this event are sparse and contradictory. Leaving a group of men behind to guard the Aztec emperor, Cort√©s left for the coast in May 1520 to deal with the newcomers. He defeated the Spanish force, the remnants of which decided to join him. In his absence, however, his men had massacred a group of Native Americans gathered to celebrate a religious festival. Relations between the two cultures had reached their low point, and when Cort√©s returned a month later, the Aztecs began their assault. Desperate and fighting for their lives, the Spaniards fled the city after suffering massive casualties (as did their Native American allies), but they killed Montezuma before they left.</para>
<para id="fs-idm281449008">Montezuma‚Äôs decision to allow Cort√©s to enter his city cost him his life and ended his empire. It was reasonable for him to assume that the potential benefit of an alliance with the Spaniards was worth the risk, but in the end it was a misjudgment. Montezuma failed to achieve the outcome he desired, because his empire was overwhelmed by a technologically superior foe bent on conquest and wealth.</para>
