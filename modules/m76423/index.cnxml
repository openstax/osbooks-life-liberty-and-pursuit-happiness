<para id="fs-idm246468864">Use this lesson as the foundation for the <link class="target-chapter" document="m76403">Stamp Act Resistance</link> Narrative, <link class="target-chapter" document="m76404">The Boston Massacre</link> Narrative, and <link class="target-chapter" document="m76405">The Boston Tea Party</link> Narrative.</para>
<para id="fs-idm208344096"><emphasis effect="bold">Lesson Materials:</emphasis></para>
<para id="fs-idm231392192">Chart paper/poster boards and markers</para>
<para id="fs-idm205975856"><emphasis effect="bold">Facilitation Notes</emphasis>:</para>
<para id="fs-idm217004592">Chart paper for each of the group posters should be hung around the room ahead of time. The number of posters, therefore, should also be determined ahead of time. Depending on the number of students in the class, and therefore how many groups of two or three are needed, certain acts may be left out of this lesson at the teacher‚Äôs discretion. For example, a class of 21 may only be split into 7 groups of 3, or a class of 18 may be split into 9 groups of 2. Likewise, some classes may require two of each group; for example, a class of 28 may be split into 14 groups of 2, with each act of Parliament being covered by 2 groups. This will allow a large number of students to participate in the gallery walk at their own pace without crowding each poster.</para>
<para id="fs-idm218767728">If students typically struggle with primary source documents at this point in the year, the teacher may choose to model one of the Acts of Parliament and the poster creation process for the class. Read the act aloud (or have a higher-level student read it), and have the class follow along and annotate. Students should defend their annotations and be walked through this process as well, and collaborate as a class to construct a sample poster for that act. This process should be allotted 10<emphasis effect="bold">‚Äì</emphasis>15 minutes, and the lesson times should be adjusted accordingly.</para>
<para id="fs-idm220386384">Students should be assigned to heterogeneous pairs or trios. For lower-level students, a differentiation option is to only require completing some of the Acts of Parliament around the room. For example, students may be required to only complete five posters, instead of all eight. The least significant acts in students‚Äô mastery of this lesson include the Stamp Act (they can learn this content through the Stamp Act narrative), the Quartering Act, the Boston Port Act, or the Tea Act (they will likely learn this content through the Boston Tea Party narrative).</para>
<para id="fs-idm208289712"><emphasis effect="bold">Extensions and Additional Resources</emphasis>:</para>
<para id="fs-idm206094464">If students finish their poster early and there are remaining groups (see Facilitation Notes), students can complete a poster for a second act of Parliament.</para>
<para id="fs-idm246486864">If time allows, students can also be introduced to the Boston Tea Party and Boston Massacre narratives from <emphasis effect="italics">Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness</emphasis> before reading about the Boston Port Act and the Quartering Act. Students can also read the Stamp Act narrative to gain a greater background.</para>
