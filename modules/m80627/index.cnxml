<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm303079456">Booker T. Washington was born a slave in Virginia, but in 1865 became free at age 9 years. He came of age in the South during Reconstruction and worked his way through Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute and Wayland Seminary. He became a teacher and founded Tuskegee Institute to provide higher education for blacks. He emphasized the need for blacks to gain a “practical education,” what we might call vocational training today. Many whites in the North and the South welcomed his message of self-help and his seeming willingness to accept social segregation between blacks and whites. Washington delivered this 1895 speech to a mostly white audience at the Atlanta and Cotton States Exhibition, an event designed to showcase new agricultural technology in the South and encourage more trade between the South and Latin America. Washington’s speech is a response to the Jim Crow conditions of discrimination faced by blacks in the South and to the New South movement, which sought to promote industrial development in the South.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">A ship lost at sea for many days suddenly sighted a friendly vessel. From the mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen a signal, “Water, water; we die of thirst!” The answer from the friendly vessel at once came back, “Cast down your bucket where you are.” A second time the signal, “Water, water; send us water!” ran up from the distressed vessel, and was answered, “Cast down your bucket where you are.” And a third and fourth signal for water was answered, “Cast down your bucket where you are.” The captain of the distressed vessel, at last heeding the injunction, cast down his bucket, and it came up full of fresh, sparkling water from the mouth of the Amazon River. To those of my race who depend on bettering their condition in a foreign land or who underestimate the importance of cultivating friendly relations with the Southern white man, who is their next-door neighbor, I would say: “Cast down your bucket where you are”— cast it down in making friends in every manly way of the people of all races by whom we are surrounded.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Cast it down in agriculture, mechanics, in commerce, in domestic service, and in the professions. And in this connection it is well to bear in mind that whatever other sins the South may be called to bear, when it comes to business, pure and simple, it is in the South that the Negro is given a man’s chance in the commercial world, and in nothing is this Exposition more eloquent than in emphasizing this chance. Our greatest danger is that in the great leap from slavery to freedom we may overlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the productions of our hands, and fail to keep in mind that we shall prosper in proportion as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour, and put brains and skill into the common occupations of life; shall prosper in proportion as we learn to draw the line between the superficial and the substantial, the ornamental gewgaws of life and the useful. <link target-id="fs-idm457591104">No race can prosper till it learns that there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem</link>. <link target-id="fs-idm443830704">It is at the bottom of life we must begin, and not at the top.
