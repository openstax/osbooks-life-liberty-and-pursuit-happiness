<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm210496400">In the first half of the nineteenth century, those who suffered from mental illness were often housed in jails or almshouses in deplorable conditions with harsh treatment. Dorothea Dix sought to bring attention to the poor treatment of the mentally ill and demand reform. As a young woman, Dix spent time in Europe, where she encountered individuals working to change the way the mentally ill were cared for. After returning home to the United States, Dix traveled through multiple states to document the abysmal state in which the mentally ill were frequently housed and treated. In 1840–1841, she visited several such places in the commonwealth of Massachusetts and later presented this petition, or memorial, to the state legislature to request legislation regulating standards of care. Dix continued to work for reforms for the rest of her life, visiting other countries to document the conditions of hospitals and serving as the superintendent of Army Nurses for the Union Army during the Civil War.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm226742272">About two years since leisure afforded opportunity, and duty prompted me to visit several prisons and <emphasis effect="bold">almshouses</emphasis> in the vicinity of this metropolis</link>. I found, near Boston, in the Jails and Asylums for the poor, a numerous class brought into unsuitable [connection] with criminals and the general mass of <emphasis effect="bold">Paupers</emphasis>. I refer to <emphasis effect="bold">Idiots</emphasis> and Insane persons, dwelling in circumstances not only adverse to their own physical and moral improvement, but productive of extreme disadvantages to all other persons brought into association with them. I applied myself diligently to trace the causes of these evils, and sought to supply remedies. As one obstacle was <emphasis effect="bold">surmounted</emphasis>, fresh difficulties appeared. <link target-id="fs-idm227750128">Every new investigation has been depth to the conviction that it is only by decided, prompt, and vigorous legislation the evils to which I refer, and which I shall proceed more fully to illustrate, can be remedied</link>. I shall be obliged to speak with great plainness, and to reveal many things revolting to the taste, and from which my woman’s nature shrinks with peculiar sensitiveness. But truth is the highest consideration. <emphasis effect="italics">I tell what I have seen</emphasis>—painful and as shocking as the details often are—that from them you may feel more deeply the <emphasis effect="bold">imperative</emphasis> obligation which lies upon you to prevent the possibility of a repetition or continuance of such outrages upon humanity. <link target-id="fs-idm230087888">If I inflict pain upon you, and move you to horror, it is to acquaint you with suffering which you have the power to alleviate, and make you hasten to the relief of the victims of legalized barbarity</link>.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">I come to present the strong claims of suffering humanity. I come to place before the Legislature of Massachusetts the condition of the miserable, the desolate, the outcast. I come as the advocate of helpless, forgotten, insane and idiotic men and women; of beings, sunk to a condition from which the most unconcerned would start with real horror; of beings wretched in our Prisons, and more wretched in our almshouses. And I cannot suppose it needful to employ earnest persuasion, or stubborn argument, in order to arrest and fix attention upon a subject, only the more strongly pressing in its claims, because it is revolting and disgusting in its details.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">I must confine myself to few examples, but am ready to furnish other and more complete details, if required. If my pictures are displeasing, coarse, and severe, my subjects, it must be recollected, offer no tranquil, refined, or composing features. The condition of human beings, reduced to the extremest states of degradation and misery, cannot be exhibited in softened language, or adorn a polished page.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm231669264">I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth, <emphasis effect="italics">in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">lashed</emphasis> into obedience!</link></entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">As I state cold, severe <emphasis effect="italics">facts</emphasis>, I feel obliged to refer to persons, and definitely to indicate localities. But it is upon my subject, not upon localities or individuals, I desire to fix attention; and I would speak as kindly as possible of all Wardens, Keepers, and other responsible officers, believing that <emphasis effect="italics">most</emphasis> of these have erred not through hardness of heart and willful cruelty, so much as want of skill and knowledge, and want of consideration. Familiarity with suffering, it is said, blunts the sensibilities, and where neglect once finds a footing other injuries are multiplied. This is not all, for it may be justly and strongly be added that, from the deficiency of adequate means to meet the wants of these cases, it has been an absolute impossibility to do justice in this matter. <link target-id="fs-idm233340176">Prisons are not constructed in view of being converted into County Hospitals, and almshouses are not founded as receptacles for the Insane. And yet, in the face of justice and common sense, Wardens are by law compelled to receive, and Masters of almshouses not to refuse, Insane and Idiotic subjects in all stages of mental disease and privation</link>.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Springfield.<newline/>In the jail, one lunatic woman, furiously mad, a state pauper, improperly situated, both in regard to the prisoners, the keepers, and herself. It is a case of extreme self-forgetfulness and oblivion to all the decencies of life; to describe which, would be to repeat only the grossest scenes. . . . In the almshouse of the same town is a woman apparently only needing judicious care, and some well-chosen employment, to make it unnecessary to confine her in solitude, in a dreary unfurnished room. <link target-id="fs-idm222467184">Her appeals for employment and companionship are most touching, but the mistress replied, “she had no time to attend to her.”</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Northampton.<newline/>In the jail, quite lately, was a young man violently mad, who had not, as I was informed at the prison, come under medical care, and not been returned from any hospital. In the almshouse, the cases of insanity are now unmarked by abuse, and afford evidence of judicious care by the keepers. . . .</entry>
