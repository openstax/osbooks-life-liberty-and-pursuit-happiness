<para id="fs-idm272238928">This lesson should follow exploration of the expansion of slavery due to the invention of the cotton gin. This lesson seeks to put into context the fundamental shift in thinking about slavery that occurred in the minds of observers of slavery as a result of its mass expansion during the early to mid-nineteenth century. Students should have the sensitivity and respect required to talk about the topic of slavery.</para>

<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm250537472">Students will read the excerpt from the opening of the <emphasis effect="italics">Declaration of Independence</emphasis> and answer the accompanying questions. After discussing the first three questions, read the following paragraph out loud with students for emphasis (on student handout):</para>
<quote id="fs-idm252007760">The Declaration of Independence was an assertion of universal natural rights for all human beings, including the idea that they are created equal and have the right to govern themselves by their own consent. At the time of the Founding, African Americans who were held as slaves were denied the inalienable rights they had according to natural law. They were viewed as property and therefore had no opportunity to enjoy those natural rights listed in the Declaration. Many Founders, even those who held slaves, shared in their public and private writings and speeches that they were troubled by slavery and saw the institution as a moral abomination and unjust because it violated the principles of liberty, equality, and consent. Even those who defended slavery argued on the grounds of economic necessity, historical precedent, and self-interest, as many recognized the hypocrisy and inconsistency of slavery with the principles they asserted. Those attitudes changed in mid-nineteenth century when some slaveholders articulated a different defense of slavery.</quote>
