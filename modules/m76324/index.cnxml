<para id="fs-idm410388816">As he disembarked from his ship onto the western shore of the Delaware River in 1682, William Penn surveyed the green country in front of him. The thirty-eight-year-old Englishman could not help contrasting this strange, expansive land with memories of the cramped prison cell he had occupied twenty years earlier back in England.</para>
<para id="fs-idm411194464">Penn was part of a religious sect known as the Society of Friends. Its members were called ‚ÄúQuakers‚Äù by their enemies because their intense meetings sometimes led members to shake in fits of spiritual fervor. During the 1660s, Englishmen harshly persecuted the Quakers, whom they considered to be dangerous radicals because of their teachings on social and religious equality. Even though he was an English aristocrat, the young Penn had been imprisoned for his illegal preaching and publication of Quaker doctrines. As a result, he became an ardent activist for religious freedom. During the 1670s, he began to dream of a colony where Quakers‚Äîand all kinds of Christians‚Äîwould be free to worship as they saw fit. This dream became a reality when King Charles II offered him title to a large expanse of land in the New World to pay off a substantial debt the crown owed to Penn‚Äôs family. Now, in 1682, Penn finally stood on the shores of the colony of Pennsylvania.</para>
<para id="fs-idm411193968">Penn had high hopes that the colony would enjoy religious freedom, as well as peace with the Lenni Lenapes and other American Indians who had lived in this land for centuries. Like all Quakers, he was a pacifist, and he was adamant that his new colony would avoid the bloodshed and war between Indians and other English colonists that had occurred in New England and Virginia. One year before his trip across the Atlantic Ocean, Penn had written a letter to the ‚ÄúKings of the Indians,‚Äù explaining that he was coming to settle in their land. He regretted the ‚Äúunkindness and injustice‚Äù that Indians had experienced from other Europeans and promised that Pennsylvania would be different. Because God commanded his people to love others, his colony would treat the Indians with honesty, fairness, and peace.</para>
<para id="fs-idm416356240">Having arrived, Penn worked on bringing his plans to fruition. The Quakers refused to take any land unless the Indians agreed to it. During the first couple of years, Penn purchased land from the Lenape and Susquehannock leaders, including large areas along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers. As he stood side by side with the Indian leaders and signed the purchase contracts (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_02_03_PennTreaty"/>), he may have felt a measure of pride that his land was being honestly bought rather than stolen from the Indians. However, he did not realize that these peaceful transactions were being aided by forces beyond his control. Since Europeans had arrived in the New World, disease and war had reduced the Lenni Lenapes to a mere five thousand people. Their alliance with the English thus provided much-needed protection from their rivals, the Iroquois League, the most powerful Indian alliance in the region, and contributed to their willingness to sell their land.</para>

<para id="fs-idm407095872">Not long after the ink on the purchase agreement was dry, the Quakers began to build a city on the land between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. They optimistically proclaimed that their capital would be a ‚ÄúCity of Brotherly Love.‚Äù The capital‚Äôs grid-patterned streets were soon bustling (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_02_03_PhilCity"/>). Only four years after Penn landed, the colony was home to a diverse group of more than eight thousand settlers of many different religions and ethnicities: Quakers, Anglicans, Dutch Calvinists, German Lutherans, and many Christians who had been persecuted in England, including Presbyterians, Baptists, and Catholics. These colonists had to obey Pennsylvania‚Äôs moral laws‚Äîno swearing, no ‚Äúwildness,‚Äù and certainly no ‚Äúwhoredom or fornication‚Äù‚Äîto promote a healthy civic society. However, they were free to practice their own religion as long as they believed in ‚Äúthe one Almighty and eternal God.‚Äù</para>

<caption>Created by Thomas Holme in 1863, <emphasis effect="italics">A Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia</emphasis> was the first map that depicted the Pennsylvania city founded by William Penn and his fellow Quakers. Holme was a surveyor who worked with Penn to devise a system of grid-patterned streets.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm407906352">In spite of good intentions to foster religious harmony and toleration, the City of Brotherly Love was not entirely peaceful. In the early 1690s, a Quaker missionary and pastor named George Keith grew concerned that Philadelphia‚Äôs Quakers had departed from the teaching of the Bible, relying too much on the ‚Äúinward light‚Äù of the Spirit. The leading Quakers thought him too divisive and removed him as pastor. Keith ignored this judgment and increased his criticism, arguing that Quaker ministers had been corrupted by their own political influence. After he proclaimed that the top Quaker magistrate‚Äôs ‚Äúname would stink,‚Äù Keith was indicted for <term>libel</term>. The dispute culminated in an attempt by Keith and his followers to set up their own gallery in the Philadelphia meetinghouse, at which point a brawl broke out and both galleries were destroyed. Keith‚Äôs followers eventually dwindled in number, and he returned to England. This dispute showed the difficulty Quakers had in maintaining authority and religious orthodoxy in their own city. Even though Pennsylvania aspired to harmony between Christians of all kinds, it still experienced strife and rivalry within its own denominations.</para>
<para id="fs-idm410376032">Nonetheless, Penn‚Äôs colony was undoubtedly a religious and commercial success. The prospect of religious freedom attracted many middle-class merchants, farmers, and traders from Europe, and Philadelphia‚Äôs population quickly surpassed that of the much older New York City. Commerce flourished as Philadelphia‚Äôs Quakers engaged in a profitable trade with their fellow Quakers in Boston, New York, and the West Indies. In spite of many Quakers‚Äô reservations about slavery, slaves and slave trading did become common in Philadelphia. Moreover, many poor whites from Britain and Europe migrated as indentured servants and owed their labor for a time to their masters. However, the climate of the colony‚Äôs western backcountry favored the growing of wheat over the much more labor-intensive tobacco. As a result, fewer slaves were needed, and small, independent farms thrived.</para>
<para id="fs-idm406352464">William Penn‚Äôs experiment in religious and political liberty paid dividends for his colony. Philadelphia became a place where Quakers, Baptists, and Presbyterians all practiced their religion freely without an established church. The capital also had a growing economy. Pennsylvania treated American Indians with justice even as the settlers moved west and established prosperous small farms. The colony became a model of religious liberty and justice in British North America.</para>
