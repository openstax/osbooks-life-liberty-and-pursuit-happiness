<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm887379872">In the mid-1960s, a younger, more radical generation of American Indian leaders emerged. The new generation embraced the term “Red Power” and sought to use the media to draw attention to the plight of American Indians and to call for Indian self-determination, that is, self-governance and decision-making on issues that affected their own people rather than falling under the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.</para>
<para id="fs-idm902994128">No protest attracted more media attention than the 1969 takeover of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, led by the group Indians of All Tribes (IAT). On November 9, 1969, a small group from IAT symbolically claimed Alcatraz Island for the Indian people and, on November 20, began a full-scale occupation. Most of the occupiers were American Indian students, many from University of California, Los Angeles. For a time, the media covered the story closely, and social activists visited the island to lend their support. Internal power struggles plagued the occupiers as time wore on, and in 1970, the U.S. government ordered all electrical power to be shut off and removed the island’s fresh water supply. Most occupiers slowly left the island, and, on June 10, 1971, federal marshals, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, and special forces police removed the remaining five women, four children, and six men. The IAT issued the following proclamation in November 1969 to announce their intentions for the occupation.</para>

We wish to be fair and honorable in our dealings with the Caucasian inhabitants of this land, and hereby offer the following treaty: We will purchase said Alcatraz Island for 24 dollars in glass beads and red cloth, a precedent set by the white man’s purchase of a similar island about 300 years ago. We know that $24 in trade goods for these sixteen acres is more than was paid when Manhattan Island was sold, but we know that land values have risen over the years. Our offer of $1.24 per acre is greater than the 47 cents per acre the white men are now paying the California Indians for their land. We will give to the inhabitants of this land a portion of that land for their own, to be held in trust by the American Indian Government for as long as the sun shall rise and the rivers go down to the sea—to be administered by the Bureau of Caucasian Affairs (BCA). We will further guide the inhabitants in the proper way of living. <link target-id="fs-idm872189360">We will offer them our religion, our education, our life-ways, in order to help them achieve our level of civilization and thus raise them and all their white brothers up from their savage and unhappy state.</link> <link target-id="fs-idm888374736">We offer this treaty in good faith and wish to be fair and honorable in our dealings with all white men.</link></entry>
