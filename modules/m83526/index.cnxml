<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm394525360">Mathew Brady was a New York photojournalist, best known for his collection of photography documenting the Civil War. Commonly referred to as the “father of photojournalism,” Brady studied under Samuel F. B. Morse and opened his own photography studios in New York and Washington DC, where he took photographs of prominent Americans of the time, including Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John James Audubon. Once the Civil War began, he began marketing <emphasis effect="italics">cartes de visite</emphasis> (small photographs the size of a business card) to parents of departing soldiers so they could have images to keep of their sons while they were off at war. Brady soon decided to document the war and, with permission from President Lincoln, he organized and self-financed a team of photographers who took thousands of photographs documenting camp life and battlefield scenes. One of these photographers on Brady’s team, Alexander Gardner, took all the photographs featured. In 1862, Brady’s exhibit <emphasis effect="italics">The Dead of Antietam</emphasis> showed the public the first ever photographs of a battlefield before the dead had been removed. These images received extensive media attention, with the <emphasis effect="italics">New York Times</emphasis> saying, “Mr. Brady has done something to bring home to us the terrible reality and earnestness of war.”</para>
