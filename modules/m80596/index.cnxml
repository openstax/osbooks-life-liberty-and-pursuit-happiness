<item>Compare this primary source with the Declaration of Independence: “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government. . . .” <link url="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript</link></item>

<para id="fs-idm342435440">The following resolutions were passed by the legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, and were authored by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively. They argued in the resolutions that the federal government had no authority to exercise power not specifically delegated to it in the Constitution, arguments later used by South Carolina and other states that finally felt they had no option but to secede.</para>

<item>James Madison, <emphasis effect="italics">Virginia Resolution</emphasis>, Agreed to by the United States Senate, December 24, 1798. “The General Assembly doth solemnly appeal to the like dispositions of the other states, in confidence that they will concur with this commonwealth in declaring, as it does hereby declare, that the acts aforesaid (the Alien and Sedition Acts), are unconstitutional; and that the necessary and proper measures will be taken by each, for co-operating with this state, in maintaining the Authorities, Rights, and Liberties, referred to the States respectively, or to the people.”</item>
<item>Thomas Jefferson, <emphasis effect="italics">Kentucky Resolution</emphasis>, Approved December 3, 1799. “That the general government is the exclusive judge of the extent of the powers delegated to it, stop nothing short of despotism; since the discretion of those who administer the government, and not the constitution, would be the measure of their powers: That the several states who formed that instrument, being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infraction; and that a nullification, by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done under colour of that instrument, is the rightful remedy. . . .”</item>
<item>A discussion about the South Carolina Secession Convention should follow the student analysis. Consider having students work through the source with partners or in small groups. Students should also be encouraged to create their own questions about the source to ask their peers.</item>

<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm338965504">On December 17, 1860, the South Carolina legislature called for a convention to discuss whether that state would make the monumental decision to secede from the United States, becoming the first state to take such action. The convention took place in Columbia, but concerns over a smallpox outbreak forced the relocation of the meeting to Charleston, where support for secession was strongest.</para>
<para id="fs-idm320451760">Lincoln was a Republican and had spoken about limiting the spread of slavery into the territories despite the results of the <emphasis effect="italics">Dred Scott</emphasis> case, which upheld the rights of Americans to own slaves anywhere. Before Lincoln was even inaugurated, South Carolina and six other southern states seceded from the Union, protecting the institution of slavery and supporting their position regarding states’ rights.</para>
