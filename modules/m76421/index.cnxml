<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm243279152">During the sweltering summer of 1787, while the delegates of the Philadelphia Convention sweated and debated the framework of a new government, the Confederation Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance. This legislation created the Northwest Territory, established a government for the territory, and outlined the process by which it would be divided into new states and how those states would be admitted into the Union. The Northwest Territory covers the area occupied by the modern-day states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of Minnesota. The Northwest Ordinance is generally seen as one of the most important acts of the Confederation Congress.</para>
