<para id="fs-idm219396032">The works of art included in this lesson can be displayed in a variety of ways as best suits your classroom and teaching situation. The artwork can be presented using a projector and the lesson can be done as a whole-class discussion. Alternatively, small groups can be assigned one high-quality color print of each work of art to interpret and share with the class as a jigsaw activity. Or, each piece of art can be printed and hung around the room or in a large space where students move around the room to interpret each, then come together for debriefing at the end. Six works of art are provided, but not all need to be used in the lesson. This lesson is based on the ‚ÄúSee, Think, Wonder‚Äù thinking routine from Project Zero.</para>

<item>Project the following image in your classroom and invite students to take a minute to observe the painting, <emphasis effect="italics">State Names</emphasis> (2000) (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_06_07_StateNames_HO"/>).

</figure></item>
<item>Ask students what they see (e.g., map of the United States, bleeding paint, only some names showing, names look like they are pulled from newspaper clippings/collaged).</item>
<item>Ask students to consider what this work makes them think of. Invite students to share responses. Encourage students to support their interpretation with reasons to make their thinking visible (e.g., ‚ÄúI think the artist thought some states were more important than others, because not all the states are labeled).</item>
<item>Tell students this piece was created by artist Jaune Quick-To-See Smith. Smith is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation in Montana. In 2004, the artist said this about <emphasis effect="italics">State Names</emphasis>, ‚ÄúWe are the original owners of this country. Our land was stolen from us by the Euro-American invaders . . . I can‚Äôt say strongly enough that my maps are about stolen lands, our very heritage, our cultures, our worldview, our being . . . Every map is a political map and tells a story‚Äîthat we are alive everywhere across this nation . . .‚Äù</item>
<item>Ask students if this information about the artist changes their interpretation of what they see in any way. If students struggle, reveal additional details, such as the fact that the collaging is meant to reveal the passage of time and only state names from indigenous sources are included in this map.</item>

<item>Tell students that art is a primary source and, like text-based documents, can reveal much about the time from which it came, the ‚Äúauthor‚Äù (artist), and the intended audience.
