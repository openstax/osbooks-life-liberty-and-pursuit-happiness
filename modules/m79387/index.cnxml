<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm382922976">The son of an enslaved father and a free mother, David Walker published his controversial pamphlet, <emphasis effect="italics">Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World</emphasis>, in 1829. Although he was never enslaved, Walker witnessed the evils of slavery and racism during his childhood in North Carolina. After moving to Boston and setting up a clothing store, Walker found himself in the company of activists who shared his desire to end slavery. Before writing the pamphlet, Walker contributed regularly to <emphasis effect="italics">Freedom’s Journal</emphasis>, the first African American newspaper published in the United States. Unlike gradual emancipationists, who believed the institution of slavery should gradually be phased out, Walker urged enslaved workers to rebel against their masters to bring about an immediate abolition of slavery. Once copies of his pamphlet made their way to the South and into the hands of enslaved workers and slaveholders, white southerners grew increasingly alarmed because they feared a rebellion was imminent.</para>

Let them remember, that though our cruel oppressors and murderers, may (if possible) treat us more cruel, as [Pharaoh] did the children of Israel, <link target-id="fs-idm683329776">yet the God of the [Ethiopians], has been pleased to hear our moans in consequence of oppression; and the day of our redemption from <emphasis effect="bold">abject</emphasis> [hopeless] wretchedness draweth near, when we shall be enabled, in the most extended sense of the word, to stretch forth our hands to the LORD our GOD, but there must be a willingness on our part, for GOD to do these things for us</link>, for we may be assured that he will not take us by the hairs of our head against our will and desire, and drag us from our very, mean, low and abject condition. . . .<newline/>*Who are not too deceitful, abject, and servile to resist the cruelties and murders inflicted upon us by the white slave holders, our enemies by nature.</entry>

If there are any changes, will they not be for the better, though they may appear for the worst at first? Can they get us any lower? Where can they get us? <link target-id="fs-idm399260640">They are afraid to treat us worse, for they know well, the day they do it they are gone</link>. But against all accusations which may or can be preferred against me, I appeal to Heaven for my motive in writing—who knows that my object is, if possible, to awaken in the breasts of my afflicted, degraded and slumbering brethren, a spirit of inquiry and investigation respecting our miseries and wretchedness in this <emphasis effect="italics">Republican Land of Liberty!!!!!!</emphasis> . . .</entry>

How could Mr. Jefferson but say,* <link target-id="fs-idm399788928">“I advance it therefore as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are <emphasis effect="italics">inferior</emphasis> to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind?”—</link>It, says he, “is not against experience to suppose, that different species of the same genus or varieties of the same species, may possess different qualifications.” (Here, my brethren, listen to him.) “Will not a lover of natural history, then, one who views the gradations in all the races of <emphasis effect="italics">animals</emphasis> with the eye of philosophy, excuse an effort to keep those in the department of MAN as <emphasis effect="italics">distinct</emphasis> as nature has formed them?”—I hope you will try to find out the meaning of this verse—its widest sense and all its bearings: whether you do or not, remember the whites do. . . .<newline/>*See his Notes on Virginia, page 213.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">There is a great work for you to do, as <emphasis effect="bold">trifling</emphasis> as some of you may think of it. <link target-id="fs-idm358309648">You have to prove to the Americans and the world, that we are MEN, and not <emphasis effect="italics">brutes</emphasis>, as we have been represented, and by millions treated</link>. Remember, to let the aim of your labours among your brethren, and particularly the youths, be the dissemination of education and religion.*<newline/>* Never mind what the ignorant ones among us may say, many of whom when you speak to them for their good, and try to enlighten their minds, laugh at you, and perhaps tell you plump to your face, that they want no instruction from you or any other Niger, and all such aggravating language. <link target-id="fs-idm403982752">Now if you are a man of understanding and sound sense, I conjure you in the name of the Lord, and of all that is good, to impute their actions to ignorance, and wink at their follies, and do your very best to get around them some way or other, for remember they are your brethren; and I declare to you that it is for your interests to teach and enlighten them.</link> . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">. . . I among the rest went up and took my seat—being seated, I fixed myself in a complete position to hear the word of my Saviour and to receive such as I thought was authenticated by the Holy Scriptures; but to my no ordinary astonishment, <link target-id="fs-idm415454880">our Reverend gentleman got up and told us (coloured people) that slaves must be obedient to their masters—must do their duty to their masters or be whipped—the whip was made for the backs of fools. &amp;c</link>. Here I pause for a moment, to give the world time to consider what was my surprise, to hear such preaching from a minister of my Master, whose very gospel is that of peace and not of blood and whips, as this pretended preacher tried to make us believe. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">. . . Can any thing be a greater mockery of religion than the way in which it is conducted by the Americans? It appears as though they are bent only on daring God Almighty to do his best—they chain and handcuff us and our children and drive us around the country like brutes, and go into the house of the God of justice to return him thanks for having aided them in their infernal cruelties inflicted upon us. Will the Lord suffer this people to go on much longer, taking his holy name in vain? Will he not stop them, PREACHERS and all? O Americans! Americans!! <link target-id="fs-idm380312512">I call God—I call angels—I call men, to witness, that your DESTRUCTION <emphasis effect="italics">is at hand</emphasis>, and will be speedily consummated unless you REPENT</link>.</entry>
