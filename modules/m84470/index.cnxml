<para id="fs-idm339124032">In the spring of 1946 Jackie Robinson was on his way from California to Florida in the hope of becoming the first African American player in the twentieth century to make the roster of a major league baseball team. Robinson was up against an unwritten rule that for decades had prohibited major and minor league teams from signing black athletes. The rule was known as the color bar, and it forced black ballplayers to perform on their own teams in loosely organized groups known as the <term>Negro leagues</term>. The color bar was part of an insidious system of written and unwritten rules, known as <term>Jim Crow</term>, that kept blacks in a separate and unequal position in the Southern states.</para>
<para id="fs-idm375701456">However, that spring, Branch Rickey, general manager and part owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League, decided he was going to lift the color bar and challenge Jim Crow. He had been scouting talent from the Negro leagues for several seasons and looking for the right man to sign first. His fear was that such a pioneer would face a torrent of racism and fight back, impeding progress toward integration. Jackie Robinson appealed to him not only because of his talent but also because of his poise and self-control. During one early meeting, Rickey tested whether Robinson had the ability to turn the other cheek by hurling slurs and insults at him. Robinson demonstrated the strength of character to ignore the taunts. On October 23, 1945, Rickey signed Robinson to play on the Montreal Royals of the International League, a minor league team for the Dodgers, in the 1946 baseball season (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_03_JRobinson"/>).</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm373976688">Both Rickey and Robinson knew the road ahead was going to be rocky, but neither could have foreseen how difficult it would actually be. During the 1946 trip from California to the Royals‚Äô spring training camp in Sanford, Florida, Robinson and his new wife Rachel were not allowed into segregated restaurants and hotels and were bumped from airplanes while white passengers boarded. At one point, a Greyhound bus driver called Robinson ‚Äúboy‚Äù and ordered him to sit in the section designated for African Americans.</para>
<para id="fs-idm344249648">By the time Robinson reached the spring training site of the Montreal club, he was considering walking away from the challenge that lay ahead. However, he spoke with two black journalists, Wendell Smith and Billy Rowe, who worked for the traditionally black newspaper the <emphasis effect="italics">Pittsburgh Courier</emphasis>. They persuaded Robinson that he had an historic opportunity to expand opportunities for African Americans if he were able to face the coming trial.</para>
<para id="fs-idm505783872">The courage needed to go on at this point was significant. As Chris Lamb, author of <emphasis effect="italics">Blackout‚ÄîThe Untold Story of Jackie Robinson‚Äôs First Spring Training,</emphasis> put it<emphasis effect="italics">:</emphasis></para>
<quote id="fs-idm394235200">Never before‚Äîand never since‚Äîin American sports has so much been riding on an athlete, in surroundings so hostile as Robinson found himself in Florida, where segregation was legal and brutally enforced, and where blacks who challenged discrimination were often jailed, beaten or murdered. At least nine blacks were lynched in 1946 and more than 20 others were rescued from angry mobs.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm515137392">After deciding to stay, Robinson joined the team during the first two days of spring training. But the second evening, Smith received a warning from a white man that a white mob was preparing to threaten Robinson. At this point, Rickey moved the Robinsons, another black player he was considering, and the black newspaper writers to Daytona Beach, where the Dodgers were located and where the group boarded with an African American family.</para>
<para id="fs-idm392116896">On March 17, the manager penciled Robinson into the starting lineup for a game against the Dodgers in downtown Daytona Beach. He failed at the plate that first day, but Leo Durocher, the Dodgers‚Äô manager, was the first to come to his defense. ‚ÄúAlthough Robinson didn‚Äôt get a hit today, he looked like a real ballplayer out there,‚Äù he told Wendell Smith of the <emphasis effect="italics">Courier</emphasis>. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget he was under terrific pressure. He was cast in the middle of a situation that neither he nor the fans had ever experienced before. But he came through it like a champion. He‚Äôs a ballplayer.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm349745008">Though Daytona Beach was strictly segregated, Robinson encountered no other major troubles there, but that was not the case on the road, because he was excluded from play elsewhere in Florida. Owners locked stadiums, canceled games, and called the police while he was on the field to prevent him from playing.</para>
<para id="fs-idm330317408">Nevertheless, his first year in Montreal was a resounding success. The 27-year-old Robinson led the league in batting average (.349), runs scored (113), stolen bases (40), and runs batted in (66). Nevertheless, racist taunts were still a problem, especially when the team was on the road. In Syracuse, New York, Robinson was taunted as one member of the local team threw a black cat on the field, yelling that it was the ballplayer‚Äôs ‚Äúcousin‚Äù (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_03_Robinson30"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm339736656">In the spring of 1947, Robinson was sent to Cuba, where the Dodgers and Royals were holding spring training. Robinson expected he would not suffer racist abuse there. But he and three other black players under consideration by Rickey were stuck at a ramshackle hotel while the white players stayed at luxurious beachfront accommodations. Rickey later confessed to Robinson that he had segregated the men, explaining, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford to take a chance and have a single incident occur.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm330359168">There was still a final indignity facing Robinson. After his first game in a Montreal uniform against the Brooklyn ‚ÄúB‚Äù squad on March 13 in Cuba, it was off to Panama for a series of exhibition games with local teams and then with the Dodgers. Both the Dodgers and the Royals were housed inside the <term>Canal Zone</term>, where all the games were played and which was then still part of the United States. As such, it was administered under Jim Crow segregation, so Robinson and another black player had to sleep outside the Zone in Panama City, where there was no racial segregation to speak of.</para>
<para id="fs-idm337495360">As sports reporter Tommy Holmes of the <emphasis effect="italics">Brooklyn Eagle</emphasis> put it, Robinson had gotten a far better break in Florida than he was getting in a territory under the control of the U.S. federal government. In Florida, at least he knew the rules and got to bed and board with local families. Here he was exiled‚Äîliterally forced to leave the United States‚Äîto find a bed. This put added pressure on Robinson and fueled the anger he had already expressed over his living conditions in Havana. However, Robinson was able to keep his feelings under control and earned himself a spot in the opening-day line up of the 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_03_RobDodgers"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm367714144">During his rookie season, Robinson performed extraordinarily well. Despite having to confront racial slurs and pitches thrown at his head, he prevailed and was named Rookie of the Year.</para>
<para id="fs-idm513622096">Robinson had integrated the National League, but what about the American League? Eleven weeks after Robinson‚Äôs baseball debut, Bill Veeck, the owner of the Cleveland Indians, shocked his fellow owners in the American League by signing Larry Doby of the Negro league‚Äôs Newark Eagles. Some of the same racist name-calling that had afflicted Robinson‚Äôs rookie season was addressed to Doby, but his most horrific trials came in 1948. Hoping to avoid the racism and racial segregation in Florida, the Cleveland Indians moved their spring training camp to Arizona, but when they got there, it was as bad as in Florida, if not worse. Not only was Doby not allowed to stay in the team hotel in Tucson but his wife, pregnant and feeling faint, could not even get a glass of water at a whites-only hotel. Later that spring, Doby had to be pulled from an exhibition game in Texas as rocks and bottles were thrown at him.</para>
<para id="fs-idm369071232">The battle for integration in baseball was eventually won, but victory was slow in coming. The last major league team to sign its first black player, the Boston Red Sox, did not do so until 1959.</para>
<para id="fs-idm358162768">The stories of Robinson, Doby, and other African American pioneers are often seen as simply part of the history of baseball rather than as a turning point in American history that served as a spark for the larger civil rights movement. As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, Jackie Robinson was ‚Äúa pilgrim that walked in the lonesome byways toward the high road of Freedom. He was a sit-inner before sit-ins, a freedom rider before freedom rides.‚Äù</para>
