<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm195297792">The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) was established in 1957 to coordinate protests against segregation throughout the South. The SCLC was heavily influenced by its first leader, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who advocated a policy of nonviolence. King and his allies refused to engage in violence, even when attacked. King’s strategy of nonviolence drew a public statement of concern from eight white religious leaders in an open letter entitled “A Call for Unity,” published in Birmingham, Alabama, on April 12, 1963. At the time, King was imprisoned in Birmingham for his participation in another nonviolent protest. While in prison, King was placed alone in a dark cell, with no mattress, and denied any phone calls. An ally smuggled in the paper that had published “A Call for Unity.” King began to write a reply on the newspaper itself, having no other paper available to him in his cell. The resulting “Letter from Birmingham Jail” was addressed to his critics directly. It was later published several times, as several versions, in the summer of 1963. The full text of the letter was published by King directly in his 1964 book, <emphasis effect="italics">Why We Can’t Wait</emphasis>.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">My Dear Fellow Clergymen:<newline/>While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities “unwise and untimely.” Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, <link target-id="fs-idm208115200">I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.</link> . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their “thus saith the Lord” far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the <emphasis effect="bold">Greco Roman</emphasis> world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">mutuality</emphasis> (n): sharing of a feeling, action, or relationship between two or more parties</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. <link target-id="fs-idm189818560">Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere</link>. We are caught in an inescapable network of <emphasis effect="bold">mutuality</emphasis>, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial “outside agitator” idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">gainsay</emphasis> (v): to deny or contradict</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left"> In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self-purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no <emphasis effect="bold">gainsaying</emphasis> the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. <link target-id="fs-idm232434352">These are the hard, brutal facts of the case</link>. On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiation.</entry>

<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham’s economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants—for example, to remove the stores’ humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained. As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self-purification. <link target-id="fs-idm471914784">We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: “Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?” “Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?”</link> We decided to schedule our direct action program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal program would be the byproduct of direct action, <link target-id="fs-idm498174448">we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.</link> . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">You may well ask: “Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn’t negotiation a better path?” You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. <link target-id="fs-idm190628848">It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored</link>. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word “tension.” I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as <emphasis effect="bold">Socrates</emphasis> felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the <emphasis effect="bold">unfettered</emphasis> realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent <emphasis effect="bold">gadflies</emphasis> to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in <emphasis effect="bold">monologue</emphasis> rather than dialogue. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was “well timed” in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word “Wait!” It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This “Wait” has almost always meant “Never.” We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that “justice too long delayed is justice denied.”</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, “Wait.” But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an <emphasis effect="bold">affluent</emphasis> society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and <link target-id="fs-idm460749584">see <emphasis effect="bold">ominous</emphasis> clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people</link>; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: “Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?”; when you take a cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading “white” and “colored”; when your first name becomes “nigger,” your middle name becomes “boy” (however old you are) and your last name becomes “John,” and your wife and mother are never given the respected title “Mrs.”; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a <emphasis effect="bold">degenerating</emphasis> sense of “nobodiness”—then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. <link target-id="fs-idm448103696">There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.</link> . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, <link target-id="fs-idm463957040">a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself</link>. This is sameness made legal. Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state’s segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured? . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate <emphasis effect="bold">evading</emphasis> or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. <link target-id="fs-idm469716560">One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.</link> . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the <emphasis effect="bold">White Citizen’s Counciler</emphasis> or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who <emphasis effect="bold">paternalistically</emphasis> believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” <link target-id="fs-idm231969392">Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.

Isn’t this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God’s will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. <link target-id="fs-idm193167472">Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber</link>. . . .</entry>
