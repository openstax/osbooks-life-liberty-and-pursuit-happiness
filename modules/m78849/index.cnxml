<para id="fs-idm260033856">After the demise of the <term>First Party System</term>, the United States seemed to enter what is called the <term>Era of Good Feelings</term>, a period of unity and patriotism following the War of 1812. In 1820, President James Monroe of Virginia ran for reelection virtually unopposed, winning nearly all the votes in the Electoral College. But this apparent political unity did not last. Four years later, in 1824, the nation experienced one of the most contentious and controversial elections in its history. Four candidates vied for the presidency (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_05_03_FootRace"/>); all were Jeffersonian Republicans representing different regional interests. Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford of Georgia was the favorite of the southern planter class; Speaker of the House of Representatives Henry Clay of Kentucky and U.S. senator and former U.S. Army general Andrew Jackson of Tennessee represented western interests; and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts was the son of a former president.</para>

<caption>This political cartoon, published a few weeks before the general election in 1824, depicts the four-way race for the ‚Äúpresidential chair‚Äù and its $25,000 annual salary. The candidates and their supporters each make remarks about their chances and their sectional interests.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm265056640">On Election Day in November, Jackson carried more than 40 percent of the popular vote, garnering ninety-nine votes in the Electoral College. Adams came in second, with roughly 31 percent of the popular vote and eighty-four electoral votes. Bringing up the rear were Crawford with 11 percent of the popular vote and forty-one electoral votes, and Clay with 13 percent and thirty-seven electoral votes. (State legislatures chose the electors in six of the twenty-four states at this time.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm243615616">No candidate garnered the 131 electoral votes needed to secure a majority in the Electoral College and thus win the election. As a consequence, in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment, the election was constitutionally thrown to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation would cast one vote. If all four candidates had remained on the ballot, Clay would have had a tremendous advantage because he exercised a great deal of influence and authority in the House. But the Twelfth Amendment stipulated that only the top three vote-getters in the Electoral College were placed before the House. With the fewest Electoral votes but tremendous influence, Clay thus found himself in an unusual position‚Äîone that could make him a ‚Äúkingmaker.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm257727376">In the weeks after the general election, Clay carefully weighed whom to support in the upcoming House election. On a personal level, he disliked Adams, but the New Englander supported Clay‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican System‚Äù of federally funded <term>internal improvements</term>. On Sunday night, January 9, 1825, Clay and Adams had a meeting. Jacksonians soon accused them of making a bargain in which Clay would support Adams in exchange for his choice of a position in the cabinet. The accusation was based on the assumption that Clay would want to be secretary of state, because that office was the primary stepping-stone to the presidency in the early nineteenth century. There was no evidence for the charge and Adams and Clay vehemently denied it, but the Jacksonians suspected a conspiracy against them.</para>
<para id="fs-idm258342416">To win, a candidate needed the votes of thirteen of the twenty-four state delegations in the House. Clay went to work, lobbying members of Congress to support Adams. As the day of the election approached, Adams had the support of twelve state delegations, Jackson seven, and Crawford four. Only one state, New York, was unpledged. Its delegation, which consisted of thirty-four men, was evenly divided between Adams and Crawford. Crawford‚Äôs main supporter in Congress, Senator Martin Van Buren of New York (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_05_03_MVanBuren"/>), hoped that a deadlock in the House might swing enough states over to Crawford. Clay, however, knew that if he could persuade just one Crawford man from New York to switch to Adams, the New Englander would carry the day. Indeed, when the balloting was complete, Adams had won the New York delegation and the election.</para>

<para id="fs-idm272689536">That night, President Monroe held a reception at the White House. Jackson politely approached Adams and reached out his hand. ‚ÄúHow do you do, Mr. Adams?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope you are well, sir.‚Äù Adams replied, ‚ÄúVery well, sir. I hope General Jackson is well.‚Äù But this cordiality was short-lived. Shortly thereafter, Adams asked Clay to serve as his secretary of state, and Clay accepted.</para>
<para id="fs-idm251904864">Clay was a leading statesman who had been speaker of the house, served on the delegation that negotiated the Treaty of Ghent, and had broad experience on domestic and foreign policy issues. In short, he was one of the best men for the job. Still, upon hearing this news, a suspicious Jackson erupted. ‚ÄúSo you see,‚Äù he wrote to a private correspondent, ‚Äúthe <emphasis effect="italics">Judas</emphasis> of the West has closed the contract and will receive the thirty pieces of silver.‚Äù Jackson did not challenge the validity of the election, because it had taken place in accordance with the rules prescribed in the Constitution, but he suspected a corrupt bargain to keep him out of office and vowed to win the next time (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_05_03_ClayJack"/>). Privately, he predicted that Clay‚Äôs ‚Äúend will be the same‚Äù as that of Judas, who hanged himself after betraying Jesus.</para>

<caption>In this caricature from 1828, Henry Clay sews Andrew Jackson‚Äôs mouth shut. The print is titled, ‚ÄúSymptoms of a locked jaw. Plain sewing done here.‚Äù What was the political message in the cartoon?</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm269584256">Jackson had correctly predicted Clay‚Äôs political future. Political observers almost immediately began castigating Adams and Clay for their apparent duplicity. ‚ÄúExpired at Washington, on the ninth of February,‚Äù crowed one newspaper editor, ‚Äúof poison administered by the assassin hands of John Quincy Adams, the usurper, and Henry Clay, the virtue, liberty and independence of the United States.‚Äù Indeed, suspicion of having participated in this ‚Äúcorrupt bargain‚Äù became a significant stain on Clay‚Äôs political reputation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm259429600">Jackson soon began organizing his forces for the next presidential election, forming an opposition party to Adams and Clay (later the Democratic Party). In 1828, Jackson won the presidency with the help of a strong national party machinery that held rallies, barbecues, and parades, and published anti-administration newspapers (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_05_03_JackLevee"/>). His victory ushered in a new era for the presidency. Most of his predecessors‚Äîwith the exception of the two Adamses‚Äîhad been part of the Virginia gentry. Jackson, by contrast, was a self-made frontier man who had been born into poverty in the Carolina backcountry but had risen through the ranks of society to become a lawyer, judge, senator, army general, and, eventually, president. His successors would be of similarly humble beginnings, thus giving the nineteenth-century United States a more democratic feeling.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm267507936">In 1832, Jackson won reelection over a sharply divided opposition. In 1834, however, the Whig Party arose in opposition to ‚ÄúKing Andrew.‚Äù The early Whigs struggled to define a positive party platform (in 1836, they even ran four regional candidates for president), but after the Panic of 1837, they articulated a program for economic recovery through a tariff, a national bank, and federally funded internal improvements. In many ways, the <term>Second Party System</term> arose more in response to particular presidential contests and personalities than to tangible political issues. Jackson‚Äôs coalition formed around Old Hickory, as he was known, with the express purpose of removing the Adams administration from power, and the aptly named Whigs came together against what they perceived as a monarchical Jackson (their name harkened back to the seventeenth-century English Whig Party, which opposed the Stuart monarchy).</para>
<para id="fs-idm259648128">The Jacksonian Era was a period of intense democratization. Many states adopted new state constitutions that eliminated property qualifications to vote and thereby expanded suffrage to nearly all white men. At the same time, many of these constitutions disenfranchised free African American men, and none gave women the vote. Offices that had previously been appointed, like state judgeships, became elective. The Electoral College was also democratized. By 1832, every state but South Carolina was choosing its presidential electors by popular vote, and most states also adopted the unit rule, which gave the winning candidate in each state that state‚Äôs entire electoral vote. These electoral reforms brought vast numbers of new voters into the political process while also reducing the possibility of a backroom deal to win the presidency. The Jacksonians helped usher in a new era of mass political participation.</para>
