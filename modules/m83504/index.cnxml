<para id="fs-idm246958688">On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces at Charleston, South Carolina, opened fire on Fort Sumter. Unable to hold out, the Union military <term>garrison</term> surrendered; thus, the Civil War began. Most Southerners celebrated the event as a great victory for the Confederate States of America. But many Northerners were outraged by the fall of the fort, and when President Abraham Lincoln issued a call for volunteers to put down the rebellion, men in the states loyal to the Union flocked to enlist in the U.S. Army.</para>
<para id="fs-idm247032304">In the spring of 1861, before hostilities had begun, construction crews were occupying Fort Sumter, building the new coastal defense fortification that was to replace other forts at Charleston. When southern states began seceding throughout January as a result of Lincoln‚Äôs election, tensions mounted, and the U.S. troops found themselves uncomfortably situated in the city where <term>Southern ‚Äúfire-eaters‚Äù</term> had long defended slavery and promoted states‚Äô rights. The garrison commander, Major Robert Anderson, moved his men to the incomplete fort in the harbor because it was safer than his previous location at the crumbling Revolutionary War‚Äìera Fort Moultrie. South Carolina militias on the mainland and nearby islands were soon joined by Confederates, including General P. G. T. Beauregard. The result was a stand-off while each side waited to see what the other might do, both reluctant to start a war, each hoping to somehow resolve the situation peacefully to its advantage.</para>
<para id="fs-idm232855632">Outgoing President James Buchanan had done little to alleviate the situation during the <term>interregnum</term> between Lincoln‚Äôs election and his inaugural. On the one hand, Buchanan could not give up the fort, because doing so would mean recognizing the validity of the rebellion and damaging his Democratic Party even more politically. On the other hand, he had promised South Carolina‚Äôs congressional delegation that he would do nothing to change the military situation in Charleston and had even hinted he might withdraw U.S. troops from the area. Ultimately, Buchanan wrung his hands in indecision, stymied by the political implications of the crisis and leaving open the way to conflicting reports and widespread rumors. In January 1861, he approved an army proposal to reinforce and resupply Fort Sumter. The <emphasis effect="italics">Star of the West</emphasis>, a civilian ship, was sent to accomplish this mission, but on January 9, it was forced to turn back in the face of Confederate cannon fire (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_08_03_StarofWest"/>). Major Anderson, not wanting to start a war, did not fire back.</para>

<para id="fs-idm253227632">The wait continued, and tension increased as anger mounted on both sides. Northerners saw Sumter as a symbol of the Union, national sovereignty, and defiance of the rebellion, and they wanted to hold it. Southerners saw it as a marker of the federal government‚Äôs power and hoped to take it in defiance of Yankee tyranny, to make it a glorious symbol of state sovereignty and their independence. Confederate President Jefferson Davis urged restraint, hoping to avoid a war and achieve independence peacefully. Throughout the rest of January and February, a stalemate resulted, with the rebels not attacking the fort in exchange for the Buchanan administration not trying to reinforce it.</para>
<para id="fs-idm233734096">On March 4, Abraham Lincoln took the oath of office and became president of the United States. He immediately inherited the Fort Sumter crisis and faced a decision point. He could try to reinforce and resupply the fort by sending warships to force their way into the harbor. Doing so would play into rebel hands by making the government the aggressor and starting a war. This would probably drive the other slave states out of the Union and into the Confederacy and further divide the North into war and peace factions. Another possibility was to withdraw the garrison in hope of keeping the Upper South states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas in the Union and brokering some sort of compromise. Taking this choice would demoralize Northerners, who would direct their anger at the administration and damage the Republicans politically. It might also encourage foreign powers to recognize the Confederacy and hasten Southern independence. The choice Lincoln made was to continue to wait, playing for time, hoping to somehow save the symbol of national sovereignty without starting a war. If the conflict did begin, he hoped it would be the rebels who shot first, making them accountable for the resulting bloodshed. But he could not wait forever, because the garrison‚Äôs supplies were already beginning to run low.</para>
<para id="fs-idm259014272">In making his decision, the president consulted with his cabinet (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_08_03_Cabinet"/>), a group of men he had chosen to represent the various factions of the Republican Party. Several of them had been Lincoln‚Äôs opponents for the nomination and believed they were better suited to lead the country than he. An immediate source of trouble in the cabinet was Secretary of State William H. Seward of New York. The favorite to win the Republican nomination, Seward now thought he would run the administration, essentially making Lincoln a figurehead or puppet. Certain that he knew best, Seward proposed surrendering Fort Sumter, arguing that this would avoid war and conciliate the slave states in the Upper South and the border states. Confident of his ability to make the decision, Seward secretly opened communications with the Confederates and let it be known that Sumter would soon be turned over to the South. Most of the other cabinet members agreed with Seward, although some hoped to somehow gain peace without having to surrender. Only Postmaster General Montgomery Blair called for reinforcing the fort whatever the cost and urging the president to pursue only those ‚Äúmeasures which will inspire respect for the power of the Government.‚Äù</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm234270608">Then Lincoln received a report from the commanding general of the army, Winfield Scott, advising him to surrender Sumter. Scott argued that the cost of reinforcing the fort was simply too great, and that evacuation ‚Äúwould instantly soothe and give confidence to the eight remaining slave-holding States‚Äù in the Union and keep them tied to the nation and the administration. Scott, a hero of the War of 1812 and the Mexican-American War, was a Virginian, and for many members of the cabinet, this background cast doubt on his loyalties. As a result, his report, combined with their reading of the political mood of the country, caused several cabinet members to reconsider their position and vote to resupply the fort. Lincoln gave orders to the army and navy to begin preparations to save Sumter.</para>
<para id="fs-idm263311712">Now worried about his political position, Seward began scrambling to save himself and his plans for brokering a peaceful resolution to the secession crisis. He still wanted to abandon Fort Sumter but advised reinforcing other fortifications. He also wanted to push France and Spain about their interventions in Mexico and the Caribbean. If those European countries did not give satisfactory explanations for their recent actions, Seward wanted to declare war on them, arguing that doing so would bring the South back into the Union. He would reunite the country through war‚Äînot against the rebels, but against a common enemy. Lincoln quietly refused to follow Seward‚Äôs advice. Instead, he gave the order for the military to send an expedition to resupply the fort. He sent word to the Confederacy that he was sending ships for the express purpose of resupply and that there would be no reinforcements.</para>
<para id="fs-idm255852032">In response, Jefferson Davis called his own cabinet together. Given the choice between peace and war, they chose to fight. Hoping to take the fort before the Union fleet arrived to try to resupply Anderson‚Äôs men, Davis ordered General Beauregard to attack. At 4:30 a.m. on April 12, the Confederate cannon opened fire and continued to bombard Fort Sumter for more than 30 hours (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_08_03_FortSumter"/>). Major Anderson had far too few men to defend his position and not enough cannon to respond properly to an attack. He made a show of resistance and had his men fire 1,000 shells back at the enemy. On April 14, 1861, he formally surrendered the fort.</para>

<para id="fs-idm257788592">The next day, President Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 men to put down the rebellion. The response was overwhelming, and many thousands of men signed up to save the Union. Even many Democrats who had been pushing for a peaceful reunion through compromise now joined the patriotic fervor. But Lincoln‚Äôs call for men also rallied the secessionists in the still-loyal slave states. Almost immediately, Virginia seceded and joined the Confederacy; it was soon followed by Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. Several other slave states known as border states, including Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, debated secession. Across the South, celebrations of the victory at Fort Sumter roused Confederate patriotism, and General Beauregard became the first hero of the Southern cause. All hopes of a peaceful resolution were dashed, and many on both sides began talking about how they would quickly achieve victory for their cause in what they were certain would be a short and glorious war. Fort Sumter, however, began a bloody Civil War that claimed more than 600,000 American lives.</para>
