<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm381984624">From the moment the United States entered World War II, it began to plan how to invade the European continent to strike at the heart of the Nazi war machine. Although the Allies successfully landed in Sicily and moved up the boot of Italy in the summer and fall of 1943, leaders knew that a landing in France would eventually be necessary to reach Berlin. Dwight Eisenhower was named commander of an Allied expeditionary force and spent almost a year planning a landing on the beaches of Normandy, France, known as Operation Overlord. On June 6, 1944, the day of the invasion, Eisenhower gave his order of the day to all of the troops under his command.</para>
