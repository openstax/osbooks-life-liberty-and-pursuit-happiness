<para id="fs-idm397577776">The fate of the U.S. economy weighed heavily on President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs mind in 1832 as he debated signing the renewal of the charter of the <term>Second Bank of the United States</term>. Congress had granted the national bank a new charter for twenty years starting in 1816, but bank advocates tried to renew the charter early to force its passage through Congress during an election year. The stage was set for a showdown between Jackson and Second National Bank president Nicholas Biddle.</para>
<para id="fs-idm390081200">Jackson had to weigh whether to kill the national bank because of his constitutional opposition to it and his fear that the bank was an engine of aristocracy. He also had to decide how he was going to challenge the precedent of its constitutionality as decided by previous congresses and presidents, and the Supreme Court.</para>
<para id="fs-idm415222064">Biddle had to decide how to react to Jackson‚Äôs opposition to the national bank. He believed the constitutional questions were settled and that the bank had great utility for the expansion of the American economy. Biddle had to work with allies in Congress to devise the best strategy to strengthen their own hand countering Jackson‚Äôs opposition. The resulting clash was one of the most significant battlegrounds of the mid-nineteenth-century politics.</para>
<para id="fs-idm394938384">Consistency and continuity keep financial markets stable and predictable for everyone involved. Uncertainty and instability are always bad for business. Safeguarding the future of the bank was thus a high priority for merchants and bankers who relied on the country‚Äôs financial markets. But farmers worried that the bank worked in opposition to the nation‚Äôs democratic principles. Its opponents described it as a ‚Äúmany headed monster‚Äù and argued that the bank was actively creating an aristocracy that undermined the interests of ordinary people.

<para id="fs-idm408244608">The national bank had been one of the cornerstones of Alexander Hamilton‚Äôs economic reforms when he was secretary of the Treasury during the Washington administration. The Bank of the United States could loan money to the federal government in times of war and encourage economic development by providing American businesses with access to capital they could invest in their firms. The first Bank‚Äôs charter expired shortly before the War of 1812; however, the war demonstrated the need to maintain a central bank that could finance a conflict by making loans and bond issues rather than by raising taxes. In 1816, President James Madison overcame his earlier constitutional qualms and signed the bank bill into law. The Second Bank of the United States was even larger than the first and became one of the largest corporations in the world. But whereas Hamilton had designed a bank on Federalist principles, proponents of the Second Bank sought to give the institution a republican character. The new bank was centered in Philadelphia, had branches in every major city, and issued new stock at a lower price to allow everyday Americans to invest.</para>
<para id="fs-idm375278272">Early banks were not as sophisticated as their modern successors. To set them up, wealthy individuals banded together to provide credit and loan money to start-up businesses and merchants. Bankers preferred to loan money to merchants rather than farmers, because merchants could repay short-term loans quickly after selling their goods at market. Because there were no credit reports, personal connections were most important in determining an individual‚Äôs creditworthiness, and early bankers loaned money to family members and friends. The close-knit relationships these establishments fostered led many Americans to view banks as elite institutions. Farmers in the nineteenth century were especially critical of them. Although they did not reject capitalism or oppose banks on principle, they worried that concentrated financial power would lead to concentrated political power, and many believed the banking sector did little to benefit farmers.</para>
<para id="fs-idm382628192">Rival banks did not appreciate competition from the operating branches of the Second Bank of the United States. Several state legislatures responded by imposing taxes on the federal bank‚Äôs operations. In 1819, the Supreme Court ultimately struck down a tax in Maryland as unconstitutional in <term><emphasis effect="italics">McCulloch v. Maryland</emphasis></term>. Chief Justice John Marshall emphasized in his opinion that ‚Äúthe power to tax involves the power to destroy.‚Äù The case cemented the supremacy of the federal government by ensuring that states could not tax federal institutions. More importantly, the court‚Äôs ruling established the doctrine of implied powers by declaring the national bank to be constitutional. When the Supreme Court issued its ruling, state bankers complained that the federal government had encroached unfairly on their industry by granting tax exemption to their competitor. Although the outcry over the Court‚Äôs decision quickly subsided, a financial panic that developed later that year intensified farmers‚Äô opposition to the banking system and resulted in bank and business failures.</para>
<para id="fs-idm416032624">The financial panic of 1819 hurt many farmers, artisans, and other small businesses, which fueled resentment against the bank and its paper currency when a Congressional inquiry revealed that the institution, in fact, had acted irresponsibly during the crisis. The Panic provided a critical turning point for Andrew Jackson and other ‚Äúhard money‚Äù advocates, who insisted that paper currency could never replace money backed by gold and silver.</para>
<para id="fs-idm386853552">The Bank of the United States soon recovered its sound financial footing under the leadership of Nicholas Biddle (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_06_04_Biddle"/>). Over the course of his fourteen-year tenure, Biddle managed the bank expertly. He worked to provide some permanence to the institution, given that its charter was set to expire in 1836, by communicating with Andrew Jackson and members of his administration beginning almost immediately after Jackson‚Äôs election as president in 1828. Biddle had carefully surveyed the political situation in Congress and realized that enough votes existed for recharter but not enough to override a veto if the president opposed the measure. Unfortunately for Biddle, however, Jackson indicated that ‚Äúboth the constitutionality and the expediency of the law creating this Bank are well questioned.‚Äù Biddle felt he had little choice but to press for the bank‚Äôs recharter during an election year because it was a relatively popular institution that Jackson would not dare kill with a veto or he would face voters‚Äô wrath.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm667349728">During the election campaign of 1832, Jackson‚Äôs opponents organized a new political party, the National Republicans, under Henry Clay. Clay believed that forcing Jackson to take a stand on the national bank would threaten to embarrass the president and guarantee his own election. The Bank of the United States was a central component of the American System Clay supported, which proposed using a strong central bank and high tariffs to fund a comprehensive system of internal improvement projects such as railroads and canals. Biddle travelled to Washington, DC, to lobby members of Congress to support the bank‚Äôs recharter. Despite the best efforts of the Jacksonian opponents of the bank, Congress passed the recharter bill with a solid majority in both houses.</para>
<para id="fs-idm370197264">Jackson quickly vetoed the bill and defended his decision on constitutional principles, saying the Constitution does not specifically grant Congress the power to create a national bank. The president also questioned the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in <emphasis effect="italics">McCulloch v. Maryland</emphasis>, arguing that the Court should not serve as the exclusive authority or final arbiter of the Constitution. Instead, Jackson insisted that each branch had the ability to decide for itself whether a proposed measure was constitutional. Jackson also attacked the undemocratic character of the bank. Congress had provided it with exclusive privileges, he pointed out, and granted it a monopoly that insulated it from competition with state banks. Furthermore, foreign nationals owned more than one-fifth of the bank‚Äôs stock. In closing, Jackson emphasized that the ‚Äúrich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes.‚Äù The wealthy Americans stood to benefit from the bank‚Äôs recharter, he argued, not farmers, mechanics, and laborers.</para>
<para id="fs-idm394237936">With no chance of overriding the president‚Äôs veto in Congress, Biddle maneuvered the bank‚Äôs resources against Jackson. He called in loans, making it more difficult for banks and businesses to borrow money. If Americans felt the loss of the Bank of the United States directly, he reasoned, they would turn against Jackson and support recharter. Unfortunately for Biddle, however, he had overplayed his hand, and the bank‚Äôs efforts alienated those who might have been most inclined to defend it. Business leaders and Congress turned against him.</para>
<para id="fs-idm361181088">As the so-called Bank War escalated, Jackson recommended moving the federal government‚Äôs deposits out of the Bank of the United States, and Treasury Secretary Roger Taney began transferring them to pro-administration state banks (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_06_04_MotherBank"/>).</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm352518960">Jackson‚Äôs opponents ridiculed these ‚Äúpet banks‚Äù as a source of corruption, but to no avail. The removal of the government‚Äôs deposits crippled the federal bank, and it dissolved in 1836. The next year, another financial panic, the Panic of 1837, swept the country. Guided in his veto decision by his constitutional convictions and political <term>exigencies</term>, Jackson‚Äôs victory over the bank doomed central banking in the United States until the creation of the Federal Reserve in the early twentieth century.</para>
