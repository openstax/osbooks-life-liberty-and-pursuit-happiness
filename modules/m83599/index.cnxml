<para id="fs-idm230825728">Richard M. Nixon was the first U.S. president ever to resign. He did so under threat of impeachment in the wake of the Watergate investigation, named for the hotel and office complex that housed the Democratic National Committee headquarters, which individuals connected to his administration had broken into and tried to bug (i.e., electronically eavesdrop) in advance of the 1972 election. When the burglars were caught, their White House handlers engaged in a criminal cover-up, including <term>perjury</term> and obstruction of justice, in an effort to insulate the administration from the investigation. These efforts had the opposite effect, however, making the Nixon administration even more complicit and reflecting badly on a president under whose watch such criminality appeared to flourish. Since then, ‚ÄúWatergate‚Äù has become the symbol of high-level political scandal.</para>
<para id="fs-idm198177120">The road to Watergate begins with a covert White House unit called ‚Äúthe Plumbers,‚Äù which was convened by Nixon‚Äôs chief domestic advisor John Ehrlichman (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_15_03_JEhrlichma"/>) for the purpose of plugging information leaks from the White House. Charles Colson was one of the conspiracy‚Äôs earliest and most enthusiastic volunteers. He (and Nixon) believed there was a ‚Äúcounter-government‚Äù in the bureaucracy that was undermining the administration, with the help of the liberal-dominated media and the Democratic-controlled Congress. Only the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù who had voted for Nixon seemed to be on his side. ‚ÄúSome aspects of this perception were true, some were exaggerated, and some were neurotic,‚Äù writes one Nixon biographer. In any case, the creation of the Plumbers was a <term>Rubicon</term> of sorts for the Nixon administration, which allowed people with questionable ethical judgment to engage in illegal activity to try to thwart the president‚Äôs alleged enemies.</para>

<caption>John Ehrlichman, shown in 1969, was a high-level advisor to President Nixon at the time of the Watergate scandal.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm909907808">The most significant of the information leaks consisted of the <term>‚ÄúPentagon Papers,‚Äù</term> a top-secret 7,000-page government report on the origins and conduct of the Vietnam War, which the <emphasis effect="italics">New York Times</emphasis> began to publish in installments in June 1971 (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_15_03_Indochina"/>). The source for the documents was Daniel Ellsberg, a 40-year-old analyst at the RAND Corporation, where he had access to a copy of the report. Nixon wanted to ignore the whole episode because it was damaging to his two Democratic predecessors, not to him, and he even hoped it might confirm President Kennedy‚Äôs role in the 1963 assassination of South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem (it did not).</para>

</media>
<caption>This map of Indochina was a part of the Pentagon Papers, a secret government report about the Vietnam War leaked to the public in 1971.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm209030400">But Henry Kissinger convinced Nixon that the Pentagon Papers contained sensitive material that would compromise U.S. Cold War intelligence operations, make the president look weak on the world stage (especially to the Vietnamese), and undermine ongoing secret negotiations (especially with China). Nixon tried to use the courts to halt publication, but the Supreme Court ruled in <term><emphasis effect="italics">New York Times v. United States</emphasis></term> (1971) that the First Amendment forbids the government from restraining the freedom of the press, even when it exposes sensitive military and intelligence-gathering secrets. The Plumbers formed the following month, and Ehrlichman authorized them to break into and steal files from the office of Ellsberg‚Äôs psychiatrist.</para>
<para id="fs-idm193645648">Some of the law-breaking Plumbers subsequently went on to work with another group, the <term>Committee to Reelect the President (CREEP)</term>. Individuals affiliated with CREEP had already broken into the DNC headquarters once and tapped the phones when they were caught and arrested during a second break-in on June 7, 1972. The often-assumed motive for the operation is that it was a standard instance of bugging political opponents to discover campaign strategies. Lyndon Johnson had used the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to do the same to the Republican National Committee and the Goldwater campaign in 1964 and, indeed, to Nixon‚Äôs own campaign jet in 1968. (The practice was hardly invented by Johnson; Kennedy, Truman, and Franklin Roosevelt had all engaged in similar activity.) But there is no solid evidence for this motive. In fact, Nixon considered his opponent George McGovern completely unelectable, and he hardly campaigned against him. When the election did come, Nixon won by one of the biggest landslide victories in presidential election history, losing only the state of Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. With the additional loss of one ‚Äúfaithless elector‚Äù from Virginia, the final electoral college tally was 520 to 13.</para>
<para id="fs-idm898914192">Nixon had no direct knowledge either of the Watergate break-ins or of the earlier burglary of Ellsberg‚Äôs psychiatrist‚Äôs office (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_15_03_Watergate"/>). He was aware that the Plumbers had generally engaged in certain ‚Äúdirty tricks,‚Äù in Ehrlichman‚Äôs words, and it was surely understood from the outset that they would be engaging in legally questionable activity. Much of this the president might have rationalized as a necessary response to the leaking of top-secret information and other threats to national security. But such a defense could not be plausibly invoked for Watergate.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm222603824">The connections between the burglars and CREEP were soon discovered. Because the FBI had jurisdiction over wiretapping, it took up the investigation. Mark Felt, the bureau‚Äôs second in command, began leaking information to <emphasis effect="italics">Washington Post</emphasis> reporter Bob Woodward, who was covering the story with fellow reporter Carl Bernstein (Felt‚Äôs identity as the source dubbed ‚ÄúDeep Throat‚Äù remained secret until 2005). The media covered the investigation with interest, but the <emphasis effect="italics">Post</emphasis>, whose editor Ben Bradlee believed Nixon was impeding the paper‚Äôs application for broadcasting licenses, pursued the story with special fervor. Still, the investigation had little impact on the election and might have petered out if Nixon had handled the matter better‚Äîfor instance, if he had immediately ordered his subordinates to cut all ties with all those involved‚Äîor if the burglars had drawn a more lenient judge than ‚ÄúMaximum John‚Äù Sirica. Under threat of severe sentencing, six of the seven individuals arrested in connection with the Watergate break-in cooperated with the prosecutors. Only G. Gordon Liddy refused, and Sirica sentenced him to 20 years in prison, plus a $40,000 fine.</para>
<para id="fs-idm900856240">Connections to CREEP soon led to the highest levels of the Nixon administration, including Ehrlichman, White House counsel John Dean, and Nixon‚Äôs chief of staff H. R. Haldeman. Dean began to cooperate with the U.S. attorneys in charge of the investigation and later testified that he had destroyed evidence as part of a cover-up that involved Ehrlichman and Haldeman. When Nixon found out, he fired Dean and asked Ehrlichman and Haldeman to resign. Soon after, newly appointed Attorney General Elliot Richardson named Archibald Cox as ‚Äúspecial prosecutor‚Äù to investigate Watergate and related crimes. Cox was a close associate of Nixon‚Äôs old political enemies, the Kennedy brothers, and he filled his investigative team with partisan Democrats, many of whom were hostile to Nixon.</para>
<para id="fs-idm911073792">During routine questioning by a Senate staffer, White House aide Alexander Butterfield revealed the existence of a voice-activated taping system in the Oval Office that stayed on at all times. Judge Sirica granted Cox‚Äôs request to <term>subpoena</term> the tapes, but Nixon refused to comply with the subpoena, claiming presidential executive privilege gave him total discretion over the privacy of the conversations. Nixon also ordered Cox to drop the request, and when Cox refused, Nixon ordered Richardson to fire him. Richardson resigned rather than comply, and when Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus refused to do it, Nixon fired him as well. This left Solicitor General Robert Bork in charge of the Justice Department, and he carried out Nixon‚Äôs order to fire Cox. The media dubbed this event the <term>‚ÄúSaturday Night Massacre.‚Äù</term></para>
<para id="fs-idm904890144">The political backlash from Cox‚Äôs firing led Nixon to let Bork appoint Leon Jaworski to replace Cox as special prosecutor, and Jaworski also demanded the tapes. Nixon again refused, and the case went to the Supreme Court as <term><emphasis effect="italics">United States v. Nixon</emphasis></term> (1974). In a unanimous opinion (minus Justice Rehnquist, who <term>recused</term> himself), the court said that a blanket claim of executive privilege, absent any specific claims that national security would be jeopardized, could not justify a president‚Äôs refusal to comply with a judicial subpoena. ‚ÄúThe generalized assertion of privilege,‚Äù wrote Chief Justice Burger (a Nixon appointee), ‚Äúmust yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.‚Äù Nixon turned over the tapes.</para>
<para id="fs-idm225159264">Meanwhile, a grand jury had indicted Ehrlichman, Haldeman, and the rest of ‚Äúthe Watergate Seven‚Äù for crimes related to covering up the CREEP conspiracy or otherwise impeding the Watergate investigation‚Äîcrimes such as conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and perjury. Nixon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator. The House Judiciary Committee had also been busy gathering evidence, and it opened formal <term>impeachment</term> hearings on May 9, 1974. On July 25, Texas Democrat and Judiciary Committee member Barbara Jordan delivered a speech discussing the nature of constitutional checks and balances and the House‚Äôs responsibility to serve as a check on executive power. It is considered by some to be one of the most important political speeches of the twentieth century.</para>

<para id="fs-idm218077968">At the end of July, the Judiciary Committee voted 27‚Äì11 to recommend articles of impeachment. On August 8, Nixon announced he would resign his office the following day. In his televised resignation speech, he said he was stepping down against his personal inclination, because the nation needed a Congress and a president working full time on its behalf, and because ‚Äúthe interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations‚Äù (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_15_03_RNixon"/>). When Vice President Gerald Ford was sworn in as president, he expressed what was surely the common mood of the day: ‚ÄúOur long national nightmare is over.‚Äù But it was not.</para>

<para id="fs-idm203789120">Fearing the continuation of ‚Äúbad dreams that continue to reopen a chapter that is closed,‚Äù Ford granted Nixon ‚Äúa full, free, and absolute pardon‚Äù for crimes he ‚Äúcommitted or may have committed‚Äù during his presidency. Ford did not think it was good for the country to see an ex-president put on trial, nor did he think Nixon could hope to get a fair trial under the circumstances. Ford‚Äôs public approval plummeted as a result, destroying any hopes he might have had of winning the 1976 presidential election. It was his turn to put the good of the nation before his own interests.</para>
<para id="fs-idm209353136">When Nixon left the White House, as Henry Kissinger observed, ‚Äúthe presidency was in shambles.‚Äù The strong executive branch promoted by intellectuals like Arthur Schlesinger had given way to fears of an ‚Äúimperial presidency‚Äù under Nixon, which, in turn, led to fears of an ‚Äúimperiled presidency‚Äù under the administrations succeeding him. The volume of Congressional legislation aimed at restraining executive power during this period demonstrates the people‚Äôs new distrust of government in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate. The division and distrust that arose then continues to ripple through American politics today.</para>
