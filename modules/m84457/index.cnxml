The nation‚Äôs citizens as a whole? Who is responsible for foreign policy? Who does the Constitution say is responsible for foreign policy?</para>

Students will practice generating constitutional arguments for and against the foreign policy action taken by the U.S. government for important events from 1898 to 1945. The first action has been done as an example. Note that some events may be more challenging to create arguments for than others. The point of the exercise is for students to see that different individuals will have different interpretations of the Constitution‚Äôs language regarding foreign policy. Have students complete the analysis questions when they have completed the graphic organizer.</para>
