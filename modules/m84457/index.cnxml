<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (5–10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm254401984">Project and have students examine the <link document="m83555">Cartoon Analysis: <emphasis effect="italics">A Lesson for Anti-Expansionists</emphasis>, Victor Gillam, 1899</link> Primary Source. Discuss what this reveals about U.S. foreign policy over time, up until 1899. Ask students to consider who Uncle Sam represents in this cartoon: the government as a whole? The president? Congress? The nation’s citizens as a whole? Who is responsible for foreign policy? Who does the Constitution say is responsible for foreign policy?</para>

<title>III. Application (20–30 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm195001216">Distribute <emphasis effect="bold">Handout B: Constitutional Arguments and Foreign Policy</emphasis>. Students will practice generating constitutional arguments for and against the foreign policy action taken by the U.S. government for important events from 1898 to 1945. The first action has been done as an example. Note that some events may be more challenging to create arguments for than others. The point of the exercise is for students to see that different individuals will have different interpretations of the Constitution’s language regarding foreign policy. Have students complete the analysis questions when they have completed the graphic organizer.</para>
