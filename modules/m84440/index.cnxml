<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm348888112">Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal policies faced only minor opposition during the so-called first 100 days of his presidency in 1933. However, as the Great Depression continued to take its tolltand especially given the increasing unemployment raterhis near-unanimous support began to crumble in 1934. A group of conservative Democrats, Republicans, and business leaders who believed that certain aspects of the New Deal were an unconstitutional overreach by the federal government formed the American Liberty League in 1934. They penned a pamphlet in that year outlining their ideology of limited government and individual liberties.</para>
<para id="fs-idm381808304">However, some Americans perceived Roosevelt’s policies as a failure because they did not go far enough in mobilizing the power and resources of the federal government to address the issues of poverty and inequality. Senator Huey Long from Louisiana was one such detractor; he believed Roosevelt’s New Deal had failed to provide an appropriate standard of living for all Americans. In his “Share Our Wealth” speech, broadcast over the radio, he explained his plan for using federal power to create what he believed would be a more economically equal United States.</para>

No; but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children; a fair share of the income of this land thereafter to that family so there will be no such thing as merely the select to have those things, and so there will be no such thing as a family living in poverty and distress.</entry>
