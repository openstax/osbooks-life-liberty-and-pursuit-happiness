<para id="fs-idm205727440">After students have analyzed the document, lead a discussion of these questions:</para>
<list id="fs-idm249952272" list-type="bulleted">
<item>What pressures or influences would have been at play in Confederation Congress in 1783?</item>
<item>What arguments might have been made in support of the Quaker petition?</item>
<item>What arguments might have been made against the Quaker petition?</item>
<item>What action do you think Congress took regarding the petition?</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm221606832">Finally, after students have analyzed the document and speculated about what its outcome might have been, then reveal the following: Congress received and read the petition in October 1783, and referred it to a committee. A few months later, the committee recommended that the state legislatures enact laws that they believed would end the foreign slave trade, but because of sectional divisions, Congress did not adopt even that limited action against the slave trade.</para>

<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm246471184">As early as 1688, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, recorded their opposition to slavery in the form of a petition (see <link class="target-chapter" document="m76394">Germantown Friends’ Antislavery Petition, 1688</link> in chapter 2). Nearly a century after the Quakers in Germantown had advocated abolition, Quakers meeting in Philadelphia crafted another antislavery petition, this time with 534 signatures. In 1783, they presented their “Address to the United States in Congress Assembled.” Antislavery sentiment was gaining strength in northern states; a 1780 Pennsylvania law made that state the first to implement a plan of gradual abolition, and in 1783, slavery was abolished outright in Massachusetts by court decision. Slavery was still legal in all other states, though its direct impact on the northern economy was dwindling. The Quakers knew their petition would face stiff opposition in Congress. The Revolutionary War ended in 1781, and the foreign slave trade, suspended during the war, resumed. That same year saw the ratification of the Articles of Confederation, which created a “firm league of friendship,” not a strong national government. The Confederation Congress had no power over state governments or their individual citizens.</para>
