<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm397803152">Direct students to the key question for this lesson at the top of Handout A: In what ways did the legal status of African Americans change after emancipation and the Reconstruction Amendments, and in what ways did their experience remain the same as under the institution of slavery? Have students examine Document 1: Virginia Slave Codes: ‚ÄúAn Act Concerning Servants and Slaves,‚Äù 1705; and Document 2: Runaway Slave Ad, 1860, in Handout A. In these they will identify the legal and personal status of African Americans under the institution of slavery. The first document will define the scope of that legal status by examining the first laws passed to define them. The second will help illustrate this status with a very personal example.</para>

<title>II. Exploration (40 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm394611776">Students will examine the remaining documents in Handout A to evaluate changes and continuities in the nature of the legal and practical status of African Americans. They will read the documents and answer the questions to interpret their main ideas. The teacher should move about the room to confirm that students are carefully examining the evidence and correctly interpreting the documents.</para>
