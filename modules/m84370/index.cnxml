<para id="fs-idm354259024">Like many southern African Americans, John W. Williams did not go far when he moved the first time, from South Carolina to Georgia. But after the birth of his son Eugene in 1902, Williams followed other black southerners north and moved to Chicago with his family.</para>
<para id="fs-idm369203360">In 1914, World War I drastically cut immigration to the United States, and U.S. industries geared up to produce machinery and supplies for the war. Between 1910 and 1920, Chicago‚Äôs black population more than doubled, from 44,103 to 109,594 people (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_Family"/>). Some 50,000 of those migrants arrived between 1916 and 1920, looking for opportunity, limited as it was. Black workers found jobs, usually grueling work at the bottom of the industrial hierarchy or domestic work in homes, but they constantly struggled to find housing.</para>

<caption>This African American family moved from the South to Chicago in 1922 to find more opportunities.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm360974224">Before the wartime industrial mobilization, African Americans had lived in one five-mile-long, predominantly black neighborhood in south Chicago known as the ‚ÄúBlack Belt‚Äù or ‚ÄúBronzeville.‚Äù Wartime arrivals had to seek housing in nearby neighborhoods, despite violent white resistance. By 1919, whites had bombed the homes of 24 black families who lived outside Bronzeville. The Williams family settled in Bronzeville‚Äôs heart, at 3921 South Prairie Avenue.</para>
<para id="fs-idm375367520">During World War I, race riots in Houston, Texas, and East St. Louis, Illinois, reflected racial tensions. Black troops in Houston rebelled when police beat a black woman. In East St. Louis, in the summer of 1917, as many as 1,000 black migrants arrived every day, and companies hired them as strike breakers. After the strictly segregated white workers‚Äô union had settled the strike, it turned its wrath on the now-unemployed migrants: ‚ÄúThe immigration of the southern Negro for the past eight months has reached a point where some drastic action must be taken.‚Äù Whites rampaged, killing 39 and injuring hundreds more. They drove more than 5,000 African Americans from the city.</para>
<para id="fs-idm336278848">Two years later, the summer of 1919 proved even bloodier. Some 26 cities witnessed full-fledged racial massacres as whites attacked African Americans. Chicago, San Francisco, and Wilmington, Delaware, saw violence, but most riots were in the South. In Elaine, Arkansas, white landowners tortured and massacred hundreds of black sharecroppers who tried to join a union.</para>
<para id="fs-idm363243088">When production slowed that summer, Chicago factories began to lay off workers, increasing tension. The stockyards, where animals were killed, butchered, and shipped, had hired hundreds of rural black southerners in 1916 and 1917. It may have been there that John W. Williams went to work when he arrived in Chicago. The black stockyard workers had to go through a white neighborhood to get to work.</para>
<para id="fs-idm326528928">On Sunday, July 27, 1919, John‚Äôs son Eugene, now 17 years old, had the day off from his job as a porter in a grocery store. That afternoon, he went with friends to Twenty-seventh Street to swim in Lake Michigan, about two miles from his home. Unofficial but vigorously enforced segregation meant that he could swim there, but not at another beach reserved for whites two blocks away on Twenty-ninth Street. But Eugene actually could not swim. He and his friends clung to a railroad tie as it drifted in the water toward Twenty-ninth Street, into the unmarked white swimming space. His friends abandoned the tie and swam back, but Eugene could not. A white man on the beach began throwing rocks at him. Then, as a white boy swam toward him, Eugene let go of the tie and drowned.</para>
<para id="fs-idm331939024">African Americans identified George Stauber, a white man, as the main culprit, but police officer Daniel Callahan, who was also white, refused to arrest him. As both blacks and whites dived for Eugene‚Äôs body, the police arrested a black male protestor. A crowd of African Americans gathered, and when one fired at the police who surrounded them, the police shot and killed him. By 9:00 that night, white gangs were roaming the black neighborhood, beating, stabbing, and terrorizing African Americans.</para>
<para id="fs-idm354762384">The next morning, white men killed two black workers on their way to the stockyards. For days, the streets ‚Äúin the white neighborhoods throated with a sea of humans‚Äîeverywhere‚Äîsome armed with guns, bricks, clubs, and an oath. The presence of a black face in their vicinity was the signal for a carnival of death.‚Äù As blacks made their way home from work in the stockyards, white mobs attacked ‚Äúscores of workers‚Äîwomen and men alike‚Äù (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_Attack"/>). Meanwhile, the coroner‚Äôs report declared that Eugene had ‚Äúdrowned because fear of stone-throwing kept him from shore.‚Äù</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm326367824">The riots continued for 10 days, and John Williams could not bury Eugene until August 5. Whites pulled black passengers from trolleys and beat them up, chased them on the streets, and broke into and burned their homes. Many black residents were trapped for days with no food, and churches and social service organizations set up relief stations for them. Chicago police seemed helpless, and the state militia arrived on July 31. In the hardest-hit areas, police evacuated black residents. As two veterans of World War I, Lieutenants Washington and Browning, walked across town, they heard whites yelling, ‚ÄúEverybody, let‚Äôs get the niggers.‚Äù The mob shot Browning and beat Washington, who fended off the attackers with a knife. Some armed black residents fought back to protect their homes.</para>
<para id="fs-idm373104784">In the end, 23 blacks and 15 whites had died, and 537 people were injured. One black Chicago minister lamented, ‚ÄúThe Negro has longings to better his condition. . . . He asks the right to work and earn a living without molestation. He asks the equal protection of the laws and that no indignity be put upon him because of his color.‚Äù John W. Williams, so full of hope when he brought his family to Chicago, had learned the bitter lesson that, despite the North‚Äôs economic and political advantages, racism could still destroy his family. Migrating North brought economic and political advantages, but it did not bring safety or the ‚Äúequal protection of the laws‚Äù (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_ChicRiot"/>).</para>

<media id="fs-idm337058144" alt="The page is titled ‚ÄúThe Riot Area Extending Over the Black Belt.‚Äù The caption reads, ‚ÄúThe crosses in the map indicate where the most serious riots have taken place. Smaller clashes occurred in many other places, fighting extending all over the black belt. The police stations and armories also are indicated, these being the headquarters of the police and militia forces poured into the district. The rioting affected most of the area extending from Twenty-second street on the north to Fifty-first street on the south and from the lake to the stockyards. While the police reserves from all over the city were thrown into the riot area, the stations directly affected are Cottage Grove, Stockyards, South Wabash avenue, and Deering street. The 7th infantry armory, the old 8th infantry armory, and the 1st infantry armory also are in or adjacent to the black belt.‚Äù The map of the city includes locations of stock yards, police stations, and street names. Crosses that indicate serious riots are scattered throughout the map.">

<para id="fs-idm356145024">Many historians argue that the civil rights movement had its origins in the post‚ÄìWorld War I era. Black leaders explored what it meant to be African American. Some blacks debated whether full citizenship was even possible for them in the United States.</para>
<para id="fs-idm319563472">An immigrant from Jamaica, Marcus Mosiah Garvey, argued that equality was not possible until African-descended people gained an African homeland. African Americans could emigrate there, and even if they chose not to, an African homeland would increase their stature and protection across the globe. Arriving in New York in 1916, Garvey founded the United Negro Improvement Association and African Communities (Imperial) League (UNIA.) Themes of <term>Black Nationalism</term> and emigration to Africa in black political thought were a century old, but after the outrages of the war years, Garveyism galvanized its followers. By the early 1920s, 700 UNIA branches had spread across 38 states, and 200,000 people read the organization‚Äôs newspaper. A Harlem UNIA march brought out 20,000 supporters who wanted an end to European colonization: ‚ÄúAfrica for the Africans at home and abroad.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm319717040">By 1919, W. E. B. Du Bois, a black New Englander who earned a Harvard doctorate and had helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909, believed Garveyism to be a diversion from securing civil rights in America. After the postwar racial violence, he wrote a call to arms in the NAACP magazine, <emphasis effect="italics">The Crisis</emphasis>:</para>

<quote id="fs-idm345397312">Make way for Democracy! We saved it in France, and by the Great Jehovah, we will save it in the United States of America, or know the reason why.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm378931648">Du Bois‚Äôs editorial appeared in May 1919. Lieutenants Browning and Washington, shot and beaten by the white Chicagoans, had fought back physically and saved their own lives. The hundreds of thousands of southern African Americans who went North in the 1920s, about 150,000 of them to Chicago, resisted as well. They built a vibrant cultural and political community. Just 10 years after the Chicago riot, they elected black council member Oscar De Priest to the U.S. House of Representatives.</para>
