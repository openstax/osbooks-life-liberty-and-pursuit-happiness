<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm382480032">The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed as part of a compromise between northerners who opposed slavery and its expansion and southerners who wanted to protect their slaveholding rights and prevent their enslaved workers from escaping to the North. The Fugitive Slave Act required northern law enforcement officers and local governments to assist slave catchers in returning fugitive slaves to their owners. Tightening up on federal enforcement in comparison to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, the law provided for increased numbers of fugitive slave commissioners. The law denied the runaways the right to a jury trial and the right to testify in their own defense. Furthermore, it imposed hefty fines for officials who failed to cooperate in the return of runaways and it offered bounties to those who captured individuals found to be runaway slaves.</para>
