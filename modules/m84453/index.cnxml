<para id="fs-idm231495872"><emphasis effect="bold">Facilitation Notes:</emphasis></para>
<para id="fs-idm216320960">Students should have prior knowledge of how to approach primary sources and of events on the home front during World War II. Background knowledge should include the context of nativism/racism that has shadowed U.S. history in general and, more specifically, negative attitudes toward Asian immigrants and their descendants. These instructions will facilitate a moot court in which students consider the same questions the Supreme Court did.</para>
<para id="fs-idm234183872"><emphasis effect="bold">Extensions:</emphasis></para>
<para id="fs-idm650790160">Encourage students to explore other cases dealing with civil liberties in wartime.</para>
<para id="fs-idm234734768">In <emphasis effect="italics">Ex Parte Milligan</emphasis> (1866), after the suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War, the Court ruled that civilians could not be tried in military tribunals as long as civil courts were operational. If government can ignore the rule of law in emergencies, the result, according to the Court, is ‚Äúanarchy or despotism.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm229599184">In <emphasis effect="italics">Hirabayashi v. United States</emphasis> (1943), Hirabayashi had been convicted of violating the curfew order that required all persons of Japanese ancestry to be in their residences between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. The Court held that the curfew was reasonable because it was a war measure ‚Äúnecessary to meet the threat of sabotage and espionage.‚Äù The reasoning was that ‚Äúin time of war, residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry . . . The Fifth Amendment contains no equal protection clause, and it restrains only such discriminatory legislation by congress as amounts to a denial of due process.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm257649408">The Court announced the decision in <emphasis effect="italics">Ex Parte Mitsuye Endo</emphasis> (1944) on the same day that it announced the ruling in Korematsu‚Äôs case, December 18, 1944. In Endo‚Äôs case, the government ruled that, even though the removal and detention process was within the government‚Äôs power as a wartime measure, once the government conceded an individual‚Äôs loyalty, that person must be released. ‚ÄúThe authority to detain a citizen or to grant him a conditional release as a protection against espionage or sabotage is exhausted at least when his loyalty is conceded. If we held that the authority to detain continued thereafter, we would transform an espionage or sabotage measure into something else. . . . To read [Executive Order 9066] that broadly would be to assume that the Congress and the President intended that this discriminatory action should be taken against these people wholly on account of their ancestry even though the government conceded their loyalty to this country. We cannot make such an assumption. . . ‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm253590640">‚ÄúGeorge H. W. Bush, Letter from President Bush to Internees (1991).‚Äù In this letter written nearly 50 years after Executive Order 9066, President Bush referred to the constitutional ideals of freedom, equality, and justice in issuing a letter of apology and $20,000 in restitution for lost property to each living survivor of the internment camps. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe can never fully right the wrongs of the past. But we can take a clear stand for justice and recognize that serious injustices were done to Japanese Americans during World War II.‚Äù</para>

<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm248373648">Lead students in a brief discussion or quick-write responding to the following prompt: ‚ÄúIf, as a result of a government order, your family had 48 hours to dispose of your home, car, and all other property before being required to move into distant temporary housing for an undetermined time, which of your inalienable rights might be in jeopardy?‚Äù Discuss: In 1942, Japanese Americans living along the West Coast, two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens, lost both liberty and property under these circumstances. Many sold homes and businesses for only a few dollars or simply abandoned their property. In this activity, students will analyze and evaluate the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in the landmark case, <emphasis effect="italics">Korematsu v. United States</emphasis> (1944).</para>
<list id="fs-idm201810992" list-type="enumerated" number-style="lower-alpha">
<item>As a class, identify the constitutional question that the Supreme Court must answer in this case. Tip: Construct this question as a yes/no question referring specifically to the relevant law in the case and to one or more provisions of the U.S. Constitution. (For teacher reference only: In this case, it might be something like this: ‚ÄúBy depriving Fred Korematsu of his liberty and his property, did the exclusion order in Executive Order 9066 violate Korematsu‚Äôs Fifth Amendment right to due process?‚Äù)</item>
<item>For student reference throughout the lesson, write the question that the class constructs on the board.</item>

<title>II. Exploration (20‚Äì30 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm253337472">Distribute <emphasis effect="bold">Handout A: Student Document Packet Part 1</emphasis>, instructing students to work through Documents 1‚Äì5. They should annotate information in the documents to show main ideas that will help each side in the controversy. Have students work individually, with a partner, or in small groups to read each source in sequence, answer the accompanying questions, and show how the document could be used to help one side or the other in the case.</para>

<title>III. Application (25 min)</title>
<list id="fs-idm253438336" list-type="enumerated" number-style="lower-alpha">
<item>Continue to explore both sides of the case, either as a whole class, or alternatively, by dividing the class into groups. If you were Fred Korematsu‚Äôs attorney presenting oral argument before the Supreme Court, what are the main points you would make for the Court‚Äôs consideration? Point to specific pieces of evidence from the documents to support your answer.</item>
<item>If you were the U.S. Solicitor General (the attorney tasked with presenting the government‚Äôs argument in Supreme Court cases), what are the main points you would make for the Court‚Äôs consideration? Point to specific pieces of evidence from the documents to support your answer.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm248705680">You might divide the class in half and assign one-half to compose the argument that each attorney would present to the Supreme Court. Remind students that this is just an exercise in disciplined thinking and they may be assigned a side with which they personally disagree. See <link url="https://voicesofhistory.org/supreme-court-document-based-questions/korematsu-v-u-s-1944/#resources">Moot Court Procedures</link>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm258961376">After both sides have had an equal opportunity to present their case, have the class vote on how they would answer the constitutional question you wrote on the board: If you were a Supreme Court justice, how would you decide this case? Explain your reasoning.</para>

<title>IV. Conclusion and Assessment (15 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm219616000">After students have decided the case, distribute <emphasis effect="bold">Handout B: Student Document Packet Part</emphasis> 2 and have the students read Documents 6 and 7, which provide excerpts of the majority and dissenting opinions in this 6‚Äì3 decision. Encourage students to compare the justices‚Äô reasoning with their own. Do students think the Court‚Äôs majority got it right? For those who say the dissenters were right, ask: What if we discover in the future that there was a well-concealed Japanese spy ring that was thwarted by the exclusion and detention process‚Äîwould that change your mind?</para>
<para id="fs-idm233059360">Direct students to read Document 8: ‚ÄúDuty of Absolute Candor: Katyal Blog Post,‚Äù which shows that in his presentation to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Charles Fahy deliberately withheld important information related to the government‚Äôs position in the case. Memos compiled in 1943 by Justice Department attorney Edward Ennis directly refuted the government‚Äôs position that internment was a military necessity. Ennis had collected documents showing that, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Office of Naval Intelligence, and other intelligence agencies, there was no known threat of espionage from Japanese Americans. Furthermore, Ennis had uncovered reports that only a few Japanese individuals were even suspected of disloyalty, and that those few were being surveilled at the time. Fahy ignored these documents in making his argument to the Supreme Court that the exclusion of Japanese Americans from their homes in coastal regions and their confinement at inland relocation centers was a military necessity.</para>
<para id="fs-idm224726032">For homework, have each student write a thesis statement responding to the <emphasis effect="bold">DBQ prompt: How did wartime experiences lead to challenges to the civil liberties of Japanese Americans?</emphasis></para>
<para id="fs-idm241232352">On the next class day, you might solicit volunteers to share their thesis and workshop several using the following questions, or have students share with a partner and provide feedback on the following questions:</para>
<list id="fs-idm238754160" list-type="bulleted">
<item>Does the thesis answer the question without restating the prompt?</item>
<item>Does the thesis make sense?</item>
<item>Is the thesis historically accurate?</item>
<item>Does the thesis provide clear and cohesive reasoning?</item>
<item>Does the thesis provide a road map or ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù for an essay?</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm253662176">Thesis statements can be collected and assessed using the criteria from the <link url="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/ap-us-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf">College Board</link> for a successful thesis statement, or with an individual class rubric.</para>
