<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm233448160">George Washington was unanimously elected the nation’s first president by the Electoral College on February 4, 1789. Washington was selected because he was the heroic, victorious general of the American Revolution and for his character. Because he had surrendered his military commission to the Congress, the American people believed Washington could be trusted with the power to be the new republic’s first chief executive. Washington had served the republic and wanted to retire in peace at Mount Vernon. When his countrymen called him to be the first president, he reluctantly answered the call. After composing a seventy-one–page inaugural address, Representative James Madison persuaded Washington to reduce its length significantly and focus on the political principles animating the new republic. On April 30, 1789, he took his constitutional oath of office on a balcony of New York’s Federal Hall before a crowd of citizens and dignitaries. The new president then delivered his first inaugural address to the Congress.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Among the <emphasis effect="bold">vicissitudes</emphasis> incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the present month. On the one hand, <link target-id="fs-idm253459056">I was summoned by my Country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years—a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time.</link> On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior <emphasis effect="bold">endowments</emphasis> from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies. . . .</entry>

<emphasis effect="bold">auspiciously</emphasis> (adv): favorable, promising</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">It would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent <emphasis effect="bold">supplications</emphasis> to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose <emphasis effect="bold">providential</emphasis> aids can supply every human defect, that His <emphasis effect="bold">benediction</emphasis> may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow-citizens at large less than either. <link target-id="fs-idm267540208">No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those [the people] of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency; and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government</link> the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude, along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage. These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join with me, I trust, in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more <emphasis effect="bold">auspiciously</emphasis> commence. . . .</entry>

<emphasis effect="bold">felicity</emphasis> (n): happiness</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the <emphasis effect="bold">rectitude</emphasis>, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them. In these honorable qualifications <link target-id="fs-idm266025072">I behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments, no separate views nor party animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests, so, on another, that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and <emphasis effect="bold">immutable</emphasis> principles of private morality, and the preeminence of free government</link> be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world. I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire, since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage; between the genuine <emphasis effect="bold">maxims</emphasis> of an honest and <emphasis effect="bold">magnanimous</emphasis> policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and <emphasis effect="bold">felicity</emphasis>; since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained; <link target-id="fs-idm241768144">and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.</link></entry>

Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good; <link target-id="fs-idm260069296">for I assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await the future lessons of experience, a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted. . . .</link></entry>

From this resolution I have in no instance departed;</link> and being still under the impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department, and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which I am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require.</entry>
