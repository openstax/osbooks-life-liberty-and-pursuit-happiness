<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm276880368">During his eight years in office, Dwight Eisenhower presided over a changing nation and world. The Cold War was heating up during the 1950s and Eisenhower made sure the United States was in a position to remain safe and stop the spread of Communism around the world. In his farewell address, Eisenhower surprised many Americans by expressing his concerns about the growing “military-industrial complex” and cautioned people to keep an eye on the growing military.<emphasis effect="italics"/></para>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">pre-eminence</emphasis> (n): the fact of surpassing all others; superiority</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations. Three of these involved our own country. Despite these holocausts America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world. Understandably proud of this <emphasis effect="bold">pre-eminence</emphasis>, we yet realize that America’s leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm254182560">Throughout America’s adventure in free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among people and among nations.</link> To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people. Any failure traceable to arrogance, or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt both at home and abroad.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">ideology</emphasis> (n): a system of ideas and ideals<newline/><newline/>
<emphasis effect="bold">insidious</emphasis> (adj): having a gradual and cumulative effect</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world. It commands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings. <link target-id="fs-idm242125712">We face a hostile <emphasis effect="bold">ideology—</emphasis>global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and <emphasis effect="bold">insidious</emphasis> in method.</link> Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle—with liberty at stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Crises there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties. A huge increase in newer elements of our defense; development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research—these and many other possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs—balance between the private and the public economy, balance between cost and hoped for advantage—balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable; balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual; balance between action of the moment and the national welfare of the future. <link target-id="fs-idm246717712">Good judgment seeks balance and progress; lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration. . . .</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. <link target-id="fs-idm260811248">Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.</link> . . .</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">plowshare</emphasis> (n): the cutting implement of a plow</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of <emphasis effect="bold">plowshares</emphasis> could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. <link target-id="fs-idm242189280">We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United State corporations.</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">imperative</emphasis> (adj): absolutely necessary or required; unavoidable</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the <emphasis effect="bold">imperative</emphasis> need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. <link target-id="fs-idm244916800">The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">akin</emphasis> (adj): allied by nature; having the same properties</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">Akin</emphasis> to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades. . . .</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system—ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">confederation</emphasis> (n): league or alliance</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Down the long lane of the history yet to be written America knows that this world of ours, ever growing smaller, must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud <emphasis effect="bold">confederation</emphasis> of mutual trust and respect.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Such a confederation must be one of equals. The weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we, protected as we are by our moral, economic, and military strength. That table, though scarred by many past frustrations, cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of the battlefield.<link target-id="fs-idm243961872"/></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Disarmament, with mutual honor and confidence, is a continuing imperative. Together we must learn how to compose difference, not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose. Because this need is so sharp and apparent I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment. As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war—as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years—I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Happily, I can say that war has been avoided. Steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made. But, so much remains to be done. As a private citizen, I shall never cease to do what little I can to help the world advance along that road.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">So—in this my last good night to you as your President—I thank you for the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and peace. I trust that in that service you find somethings worthy; as for the rest of it, I know you will find ways to improve performance in the future.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">You and I—my fellow citizens—need to be strong in our faith that all nations, under God, will reach the goal of peace with justice. <link target-id="fs-idm243334208">May we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle, confident but humble with power, diligent in pursuit of the Nation’s great goals.</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">To all the peoples of the world, I once more give expression to America’s prayerful and continuing inspiration:</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">scourge</emphasis> (n): an instrument of punishment or criticism</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings; that those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibilities; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; that the <emphasis effect="bold">scourges</emphasis> of poverty, disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.</entry>
