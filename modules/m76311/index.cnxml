<para id="fs-idm224585216">This primary source is an example of an oral tradition, which is defined for students in the introduction to the document. Because there are very few accounts from a Native American perspective prior to European contact, oral traditions can provide an important piece of the puzzle in understanding the past, because they express how a people see themselves. At the same time, oral traditions can be complicated because of the issue of translation and the lack of cultural context. After completing the historical reasoning questions for this source, lead students in a discussion of the importance of considering point of view, purpose, audience, and limitations for any source in history, not merely oral traditions, because approaching sources critically is an important skill for the AP Exam and the study of history in general.</para>
<para id="fs-idm226338048">It can be helpful for context to allow students the opportunity to look at the websites for the six nations that constitute the Iroquois Confederacy today, if time permits.</para>

<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm234828848">Very few written sources exist from the perspective of any North American Indians before European contact. This poses a huge challenge to scholars wishing to learn about the enormous economic, political, and cultural diversity of these groups before the arrival of Europeans. Historians are left with the archeological record, European accounts of first encounters, and Native American oral traditions. Oral traditions consist of stories handed down through generations, yet our records of these traditions were often compiled after European contact.</para>
<para id="fs-idm225158640">The Iroquois Confederacy was centered in what is today upstate New York and was one of two large chiefdoms that existed when English colonists arrived on the eastern seaboard (the other being the Powhatan Confederacy in eastern Virginia). The following source recounts the foundation of the Iroquois Confederacy, or Haudenosaunee, as the member nations refer to themselves. The confederacy is believed to date from c. 1570–1600; this version of its creation was first published in 1881 by a Tuscarora chief, Elias Johnson, in a work entitled “Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations and History of the Tuscarora Indians.”</para>
