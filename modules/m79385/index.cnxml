<para id="fs-idm229668896">Guide discussion to arrive at the fact that this is a question that has inspired debate and continues to do so. In the following activity, they will be looking at the nature of the Union. This was especially relevant in the first half of the nineteenth century as the expansion of the country and slavery led to a sectional debate about the nature of the Union. Was the Union ‚ÄúWe the people‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe the states‚Äù? Have students draw on their own paper (landscape orientation) a spectrum as shown on the board. As students read the excerpts provided, they will write the name of each document in the appropriate location on their spectrum.</para>

<item>Depending on the method you used to have students do the initial reading and analysis on day 1, conduct a discussion that allows students to consider all the documents and share their responses to the questions in the packet. They may share their responses as a whole class or, for example, in the second stage of jigsaw groups, through inner/outer circle fishbowl discussion, and so forth.</item>
