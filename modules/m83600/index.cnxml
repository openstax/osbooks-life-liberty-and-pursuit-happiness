<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (15 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm456711088">Have students define the terms ‚Äúlimited government,‚Äù ‚Äúinalienable/natural rights,‚Äù ‚Äúpositive rights,‚Äù ‚Äúclassical liberalism,‚Äù and ‚Äúmodern liberalism‚Äù in their own words to the best of their ability. Allow them to use <emphasis effect="bold">Handout A</emphasis> if necessary, depending on their familiarity with constitutional principles. A full list of principles and virtues is provided in <emphasis effect="bold">Handout D</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm189935568">Lead a classroom discussion about student answers and, if necessary, clarify the difference between natural rights and positive rights. All people possess natural rights from birth, and they can only be abridged through due process of law. For example, a person‚Äôs right to liberty may be taken away if they commit a serious crime and are convicted in a fair trial. Positive rights are entitlements granted to citizens by the government. This right requires that the government provide something to a citizen. Positive rights can also be easier to take away. For example, if health care is provided by government, a person‚Äôs right to health care can be taken away if a new political party takes control of the government and passes budget cuts. Because positive rights require the government acting in a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù manner by granting things to citizens, enforcing such rights requires a larger and more active government. Natural rights, on the other hand, require the government to prevent itself and others from infringing on a citizen‚Äôs ability to act. Ensure students are defining these terms on their handout for reference throughout the lesson.</para>
