<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm237798288">After reports of the June 17, 1972, break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate Building in Washington, DC, a growing investigation into the incident began to encircle President Richard Nixon and his reelection campaign. Beginning that August and continuing for almost two years, Nixon denied any White House connection with the burglary. Multiple investigations sought to learn “What did the president know and when did he know it?” After reports of a recording system inside the Oval Office became public, Nixon was eventually forced to hand over all tapes of the recordings. A particular recording from June 23, 1972, became known as the “Smoking Gun” tape. This conversation between the president and his advisor H.R. Haldeman revealed that the president began actively participating in a cover-up of his campaign’s illegal activities less than a week after the Watergate burglary. Nixon was accused of obstruction of justice by the use of hush money and because he instructed various government officials to order other departments to thwart the investigation. Nixon never faced a formal impeachment or other legal proceedings because he resigned from the presidency and was pardoned by his vice president and successor, Gerald Ford.</para>
