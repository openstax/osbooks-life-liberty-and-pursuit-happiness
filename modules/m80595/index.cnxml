<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm209046096">In 1858, Abraham Lincoln challenged Stephen A. Douglas for Douglas’s seat in the U.S. Senate. The two men engaged in seven open-air debates that garnered national attention. Douglas and Lincoln differed in their support of the popular sovereignty doctrine, recently called into question in the 1857 Supreme Court decision of <emphasis effect="italics">Dred Scott v. Sandford</emphasis>. In the Springfield speech, Lincoln famously stated, “A house divided against itself cannot stand” and pointed out the flaws in the popular sovereignty doctrine, which had allowed for the inhabitants of a territory to decide by majority vote whether slavery would be permitted there. In his reply two months later, Douglas explained his views on popular sovereignty in what would become known as the Freeport Doctrine. Despite the recent <emphasis effect="italics">Dred Scott</emphasis> decision, Douglas held that the people of the territories had the right to decide for themselves, via the ballot, whether slavery should be permitted in the territory. Though Lincoln lost the election to Douglas, their debates brought Lincoln national attention and ultimately damaged Douglas’s career.</para>

I do not expect the Union to be <emphasis effect="italics">dissolved</emphasis>—I do not expect the house to <emphasis effect="italics">fall</emphasis>—but I <emphasis effect="italics">do</emphasis> expect it will cease to be divided.

<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">Let any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination—piece of <emphasis effect="italics">machinery</emphasis>, so to speak—<link target-id="fs-idm227055712">compounded of the Nebraska doctrine, and the Dred Scott decision.</link> Let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do, and <emphasis effect="italics">how well</emphasis> adapted; but also, let him study the <emphasis effect="italics">history</emphasis> of its construction . . .</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">The notable argument of “<emphasis effect="italics">squatter sovereignty</emphasis>,” otherwise called “<emphasis effect="italics">sacred right of self-government</emphasis>” . . . was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: That if any <emphasis effect="italics">one</emphasis> man choose to enslave <emphasis effect="italics">another</emphasis>, no <emphasis effect="italics">third</emphasis> man shall be allowed to object. That argument was incorporated into the Nebraska bill itself, in the language which follows: “<emphasis effect="italics">It being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or state, nor to exclude it therefrom; but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States</emphasis>.” . . .</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">“But,” said opposition members, “let us <emphasis effect="italics">amend</emphasis> the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the Territory may exclude slavery.” <link target-id="fs-idm202500784">“Not we,” said the friends of the measure; and down they voted the amendment.</link> . . .</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">The several points of the Dred Scott decision, in connection with Senator Douglas’s “care not” policy, constitute the piece of machinery, in its <emphasis effect="italics">present</emphasis> state of advancement. . . .</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">First, that no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no descendant of such slave, can ever be a <emphasis effect="italics">citizen</emphasis> of any State, in the sense of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States. This point is made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible event, of the benefit of that provision of the United States Constitution, which declares that “The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.”</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">Secondly, that “subject to the Constitution of the United States,” neither <emphasis effect="italics">Congress</emphasis> nor a <emphasis effect="italics">Territorial Legislature</emphasis> can exclude slavery from any United States Territory. This point is made in order that individual men may <emphasis effect="italics">fill up</emphasis> the territories with slaves, without danger of losing them as property, and thus to enhance the chances of <emphasis effect="italics">permanency</emphasis> to the institution through all the future.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm229872144">Thirdly, that whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free State, makes him free, as against the holder, the United States courts will not decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave State the negro may be forced into by the master.</link> . . .</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">It should not be overlooked that, by the Nebraska Bill, the people of a <emphasis effect="italics">State</emphasis> as well as <emphasis effect="italics">Territory</emphasis>, were to be left “perfectly free,” “subject <emphasis effect="italics">only to the Constitution</emphasis>.” Why mention a <emphasis effect="italics">State</emphasis>? They were legislating for <emphasis effect="italics">territories</emphasis>, and not <emphasis effect="italics">for</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">about</emphasis> States. Certainly the people of a State <emphasis effect="italics">are</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">ought</emphasis> to be subject to the Constitution of the United States; but why is mention of this <emphasis effect="italics">lugged</emphasis> into this merely <emphasis effect="italics">territorial</emphasis> law? Why are the people of a <emphasis effect="italics">territory</emphasis> and the people of a <emphasis effect="italics">state</emphasis> therein <emphasis effect="italics">lumped</emphasis> together, and their relation to the Constitution therein treated as being <emphasis effect="italics">precisely</emphasis> the same?</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">While the opinion of <emphasis effect="italics">the Court</emphasis>, by Chief Justice Taney, in the Dred Scott case, and the separate opinions of all the concurring Judges, expressly declare that the Constitution of the United States neither permits Congress nor a Territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any United States territory, <link target-id="fs-idm221884032">they all <emphasis effect="italics">omit</emphasis> to declare whether or not the same Constitution permits a <emphasis effect="italics">state</emphasis>, or the people of a State, to exclude it.</link> . . .</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">Put <emphasis effect="italics">that</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">that</emphasis> together, and we have another nice little niche, which we may, ere long, see filled with another Supreme Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit a <emphasis effect="italics">state</emphasis> to exclude slavery from its limits. And this may especially be expected if the doctrine of “care not whether slavery be voted <emphasis effect="italics">down</emphasis> or voted <emphasis effect="italics">up</emphasis>,” shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when made.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left">Such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all the States. <link target-id="fs-idm214473440">Welcome, or unwelcome, such decision <emphasis effect="italics">is</emphasis> probably coming, and will soon be upon us, unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met and overthrown.</link></entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">The next question <emphasis effect="bold">propounded</emphasis> to me by Mr. Lincoln is, can the people of a Territory in any lawful way, against the wishes of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution? I answer emphatically, as Mr. Lincoln has heard me answer a hundred times from every stump in Illinois, that in my opinion <link target-id="fs-idm180621264">the people of a Territory can, by lawful means, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution.</link> Mr. Lincoln knew that I had answered that question over and over again. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations. (Right, right.) Those police regulations can only be established by the local legislature, and if the people are opposed to slavery they will elect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the contrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension. <link target-id="fs-idm216129248">Hence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on that abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave Territory or a free Territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska bill.</link> I hope Mr. Lincoln deems my answer satisfactory on that point. . . .</entry>

The language of that bill which I have quoted, gave the full power and the full authority over the subject of slavery, affirmatively and negatively, to introduce it or exclude it, so far as the Constitution of the United States would permit. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">He tells you the Union cannot exist unless the States are all free or all slave; he tells you that he is opposed to making them all slave, and hence he is for making them all free, in order that the Union may exist; and yet he will not say that he will not vote against another slave State, knowing that the Union must be dissolved if he votes for it. <link target-id="fs-idm213591616">I ask you if that is fair dealing</link>? . . . Show me that it is my duty in order to save the Union to do a particular act, and I will do it if the Constitution does not prohibit it. (Applause.) I am not for the dissolution of the Union under any circumstances. (Renewed applause.) I will pursue no course of conduct that will give just cause for the <emphasis effect="bold">dissolution</emphasis> of the Union. The hope of the friends of freedom throughout the world rests upon the perpetuity of this Union. The down-trodden and oppressed people who are suffering under European despotism all look with hope and anxiety to the American Union as the only resting place and permanent home of freedom and self-government.</entry>
