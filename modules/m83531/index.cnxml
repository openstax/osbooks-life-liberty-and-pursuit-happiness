<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm409523264">In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared a national Thanksgiving holiday. Six years later, in 1869, Thomas Nast’s “Uncle Sam’s Thanksgiving Dinner” appeared in the November 20 issue of <emphasis effect="italics">Harper’s Weekly</emphasis>. <emphasis effect="italics">Harper’s Weekly</emphasis> covered domestic and foreign news as well as fiction, essays, and illustrations. Thomas Nast was the magazine’s most famous and influential contributor; his work appeared in <emphasis effect="italics">Harpers Weekly</emphasis> from the late 1850s to the mid-1880s. When Nast’s Thanksgiving cartoon was published in 1869, Congress had recently passed the Fifteenth Amendment, which granted men the right to vote regardless of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” and state legislatures were in the process of debating the ratification of the amendment.</para>
<para id="fs-idm385013408">In the first image, Uncle Sam, standing on the far right, carves a turkey. Columbia, seated on the far left, speaks to a Chinese man. Americans from all around the world sit at the table. On the wall hang portraits of three presidents: Lincoln, George Washington, and Ulysses S. Grant. Behind Uncle Sam is a painting of Castle Garden, the main immigration processing center in New York City before the opening of Ellis Island in 1892.</para>
<para id="fs-idm364684448">Despite the passage of the Reconstruction Amendments (i.e., the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments), the idea of allowing African American men to vote and receive full civil rights met with local resistance in the South. The second featured image by Thomas Nast, “The Union As It Was,” also appeared in <emphasis effect="italics">Harper’s Weekly</emphasis>, on October 10, 1874. A member of the White League and a Ku Klux Klan member shake hands over a shield depicting “The Lost Cause.”</para>

In the center of the table is the Temple of Liberty on top of the words “Self Government” and “Universal Suffrage.” Portraits of Lincoln, Washington, and Grant hang on the walls along with an American flag and a banner that says “First Amendment.” The words “Come One, Come All” and “Free and Equal” are on either side of the title of the cartoon, which is “Uncle Sam’s Thanksgiving Dinner.”">
