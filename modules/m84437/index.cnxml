<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm239716928">When the newly elected president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, addressed the nation on his first inauguration day, March 4, 1933, the economic collapse of the Great Depression had left many Americans afraid. About one-fourth of the industrial work force was out of a job, and many of the rest were working only part-time or for lower wages. Agriculture, which employed one-third of the nation’s work force, was stricken. Cotton and wheat farmers found themselves with huge surpluses that sold well below the cost of production. Other farmers were plagued by drought that destroyed crops. Everywhere, indebted farmers lost their farms when they could not pay their taxes or repay mortgages. In the cities, 1,000 homeowners a day were losing their homes. Despite the efforts of Roosevelt’s predecessor, President Hoover, many Americans blamed him for the crisis. Roosevelt had promised a “new deal for the American people” when he accepted the Democratic nomination for president in 1932. He pledged to act and experiment with the economy but was short on details. On his inauguration day, he spoke to the American people about how he planned to address the crisis. His first inaugural address was broadcast nationwide on several radio stations, allowing millions of Americans to listen to their new president’s vision for the country.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a <emphasis effect="bold">candor</emphasis> and a decision which the present situation of our Nation impels. This is <emphasis effect="bold">preeminently</emphasis> the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is <link target-id="fs-idm237408096">essential to victory</link>. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind’s goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and abdicated. <link target-id="fs-idm258316272">Practices of the <emphasis effect="bold">unscrupulous</emphasis> money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men</link>.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm227883216">Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources.</link></entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land. The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character. <link target-id="fs-idm241156800">There are many ways in which it can be helped</link>, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act and act quickly.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm241134880">Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order; there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people’s money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.</link></entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we can not merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good. This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced. <link target-id="fs-idm210427152">It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations.</link></entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm221590464">It is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure.</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption.</entry>

<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. <link target-id="fs-idm255917536">I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis--broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.</link> . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">We do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have not failed.

In the spirit of the gift I take it.</link></entry>
