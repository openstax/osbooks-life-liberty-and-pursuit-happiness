<para id="fs-idm332026864">The baby boom generation came of age during the Cold War in an affluent economy. When they entered college in the early 1960s, some of the young people were influenced by reading the works of radical critics of postwar America. Those intellectuals questioned the Cold War foreign policy of communist containment and searched for meaning in corporate and suburban America, which they considered conformist. Three critical academics, in particular, had an enormous influence on college campuses during the 1960s: Columbia sociologist C. Wright Mills, Wisconsin historian William A. Williams, and Brandeis philosopher Herbert Marcuse. The intellectual foundation of the 1960s university protest against American foreign policy and the Vietnam War can be found in their books, articles, and lectures.</para>
<para id="fs-idm509934768">Mills believed a ‚Äúpower elite‚Äù ruled the United States. He contended that, behind the facade of reform during the Great Depression, federal bureaucrats, corporate executives, and union leaders had forged an undemocratic alliance. The worst members of the power elite, Mills believed, were union leaders who had betrayed their communist or ‚ÄúOld Left‚Äù allies. Labor leaders, however, were only part of the problem. In Mills‚Äôs view, the white working class was racist and imperialist. It was up to intellectuals, chiefly faculty and students, to become the vanguard of a ‚ÄúNew Left.‚Äù Radicalized college graduates would become the teachers, journalists, and bureaucrats who would destroy the Power Elite from within.</para>
<para id="fs-idm471086272">Where Mills dissected post‚ÄìWorld War II power relations, Williams transformed the historical study of American foreign policy. To Williams, the United States had always been an expansionist nation. It was irrelevant which political party executed American foreign policy, because both Republicans and Democrats promoted a ‚Äúliberal capitalist State.‚Äù Williams concluded the United States could not end injustice at home until it had dismantled its empire abroad.</para>
<para id="fs-idm359422816">Unlike Williams and Mills, Marcuse was a refugee from Nazi Germany with first-hand exposure to totalitarian rule. The lessons Marcuse drew from that experience shaped his view of the United States, which he came to regard as only marginally different from Nazi Germany. Marcuse believed democracy was a disguise that hid America‚Äôs true dictatorial nature. When civil libertarians called for all points of view to be heard, they were really promoting what Marcuse called ‚Äúoppressive tolerance.‚Äù Free speech allowed racism and imperialism to flourish, he asserted. The pursuit of social justice required intellectuals to shut down their ideological opponents, whether by verbally disrupting their talks or by resorting to violence.</para>
<para id="fs-idm333927808">The rise and evolution of the 1960s New Left owed much to Mills, Williams, and Marcuse. In 1962, the recently formed <term>Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)</term> (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_14_03_Dow"/>) met at Port Huron, Michigan. Fifty-nine delegates, mostly students from such elite universities as Brandeis, Harvard, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Yale, drafted a manifesto, ‚ÄúThe Port Huron Statement.‚Äù SDS became the focus of campus anti-war protest, even though other peace groups arose, including the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (SMC).</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm346048912">Drawing inspiration from Mills and Williams, Tom Hayden, the principle author of the ‚ÄúPort Huron Statement,‚Äù proclaimed that ‚Äúexaggerated and conservative anticommunism seriously weaken democratic movements and spawn movements contrary to the interests of basic freedoms and peace.‚Äù Although Marcuse‚Äôs works were not explicitly cited at the 1962 SDS meeting, there were members who acted in his spirit. Al Haber, the first SDS president, had argued a year earlier that student activists should not tolerate their conservative counterparts on campus, because they were ‚Äúracist, militaristic, imperialist butchers.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm344147312">Initially, SDS experienced slow growth. SDSers threw themselves into community civil rights demonstrations, picketing stores that would not serve African Americans. In 1964, a few hundred white college students, some of them SDSers, went to Mississippi to participate in a voter registration drive known as ‚ÄúFreedom Summer.‚Äù Southern law enforcement responded with violence, most famously assisting in the execution of three civil rights volunteers in Philadelphia, Mississippi.</para>
<para id="fs-idm366265792">Freedom Summer galvanized its participants. White students who returned from the South took part in large-scale demonstrations, most notably the 1964 Berkeley Free Speech Movement. Meanwhile, many African American students came away from their experiences convinced they must separate themselves from whites if they were to control their destinies. In 1966, SNCC, the largest black student civil rights organization, expelled its white members.</para>
<para id="fs-idm498640432">Democratic president Lyndon Johnson‚Äôs escalation of the Vietnam War in 1965 gave SDS a cause of its own, as well as a recruiting boost. SDS leaders opposed the war because they felt it was unjust and feared being drafted. As the war continued to escalate, so did the militancy of anti-war students.</para>
<para id="fs-idm347703456">College campuses became centers of anti-war protest for several reasons. First, the United States had recently welcomed the largest birth cohort in its history; 76 million people were born during the baby boom from 1946 to 1964. Subsequently, college enrollment swelled, from three million in 1960 to 10 million by 1970. The number of faculty also increased, from 196,000 in 1948 to more than 500,000 20 years later. Most of the student and faculty anti-war activists were clustered in the liberal arts.</para>
<para id="fs-idm350956944">Second, along with the enrollment growth of universities, many colleges engaged in military-related research or allowed recruiters from corporations with military contracts to come to campus in search of new employees. Recruiters from Dow Chemical and General Electric (GE), among others, became targets of student and faculty protesters (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_14_03_GEPoster"/>). Dow aroused anti-war ire because it manufactured napalm, a chemical weapon used in Vietnam; GE made military aviation equipment. By 1967, corporate recruiters were not just being heckled; some were assaulted.</para>

<caption>This 1969 poster from SMC denounced General Electrics as a war profiteer.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm629565648">Third, given the size of the baby boom cohort, the Department of Defense could afford to give draft deferments to millions of male students. Because just 17 percent of college students came from working- and lower-middle-class families, it was no surprise that 80 percent of the youths who served in the military came from blue-collar backgrounds. Although students could avoid the Vietnam War by remaining in college until they were too old to be drafted, there was always the danger they would flunk out and then be drafted. Fear of the draft fed the ranks of anti-war protestors.</para>
<para id="fs-idm332331968">By 1968, SDS had grown to 100,000 members. Student anti-war protestors had a common demographic profile. Most came from middle- to upper-middle-class families and grew up in post‚ÄìWorld War II suburbs, where there were few working-class whites or racial minorities. Some claimed elite backgrounds. SDS leader Rennie Davis, who helped organize the disruption of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_14_03_DNCProtest"/>), was the son of one of President Truman‚Äôs foreign policy architects. Craig McNamara, the son of Johnson‚Äôs secretary of defense, kept a communist North Vietnamese flag in his Stanford University dorm room and smashed shop windows during anti-war protests.</para>

</media>
<caption>In the summer of 1968, numerous students and activists violently protested outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Federal troops were sent in to restore order.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm356619456">Ninety-five percent of anti-war student activists had been brought up in Democratic households. Few Republicans became anti-war activists; Diana Oughton, the daughter of a wealthy Illinois business executive and politician, was a notable exception. A third of SDS members had parents who were part of the 1930s Old Left. Given their ideological upbringing, such New Left activists were given the nickname ‚Äú<term>red diaper babies</term>.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm515331040">If anti-war student activists had working-class backgrounds, they tended to go to less elite state universities; for example, Kent State as opposed to Michigan. They were often leery of engaging in violent protests and argued that police officers and soldiers carried loaded guns, which they would use if they felt threatened. Students from more affluent backgrounds were often dismissive of such warnings because they often had less familiarity with the police or military.</para>
<para id="fs-idm386866672">By 1969, the campus anti-war movement began to collapse. Republican President Richard Nixon suspected that most students protested the Vietnam War because they feared being drafted. He ended the student deferment and established a draft lottery. Because Nixon was then withdrawing U.S. troops from South Vietnam, the higher a young man‚Äôs draft number, the less likely he would be inducted. Nearly all campus anti-war protest ended. Although Nixon‚Äôs April 1970 invasion of Cambodia triggered renewed student unrest and led to the killing of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, once it became obvious that he was not calling up more troops, the demonstrations ended.</para>
<para id="fs-idm329362096">Campus anti-war protest also faded away in 1969 after SDS splintered. One SDS faction, known as Progressive Labor (PL), followed the teachings of Chinese communist leader Mao Tse-Tung. SDS-PL recognized that a minority movement of privileged intellectuals was doomed and therefore went into factories to recruit white workers. Its efforts failed, vindicating Mills‚Äôs contention that working-class whites were too culturally conservative to become revolutionaries.</para>
<para id="fs-idm461257488">Another SDS faction became known as the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM). RYM took its inspiration from a 1965 Bob Dylan song, ‚ÄúSubterranean Homesick Blues,‚Äù which had an enigmatic line: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.‚Äù The SDS-RYM faction embraced the name ‚ÄúWeathermen.‚Äù The Weathermen hoped to launch a guerrilla insurgency in the United States. As they chanted, ‚ÄúBring the war home!‚Äù (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_14_03_Weather"/>), they attempted to assassinate police officers and soldiers, rob armored cars and banks, burn campus Reserve Officers‚Äô Training Corps (ROTC) buildings, and plant bombs in corporate offices.</para>
<figure id="BRI_APUSH_14_03_Weather" class="scaled-down-60">
<media id="fs-idm377246400" alt="The front page of Osawatomie, Spring 1975, No.1 issue Weather Underground Organization. The photograph, called ‚ÄúThe Battle of Boston‚Äù and in red and black, shows a protesting crowd holding a sign that reads ‚ÄúNo! To racism.‚Äù">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/BRI_APUSH_14_03_Weather.jpg"/>
</media>
<caption>The Weathermen established a periodical called the <emphasis effect="italics">Osawatomie</emphasis>, named after the site of John Brown‚Äôs massacre during Bleeding Kansas, to promote their revolutionary message. This was the cover of the spring 1975 edition.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm484124304">The Weathermen failed at nearly everything they attempted. In 1970, three members died while constructing a bomb they had planned to detonate at a military installation. Diana Oughton was among the dead, as was Terry Robbins, who had helped organize the Weathermen at Kent State. Most of the Weathermen went underground, eluding the FBI for years until they resurfaced. Few served any jail time.</para>
