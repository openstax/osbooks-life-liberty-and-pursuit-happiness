<para id="fs-idm240053952">On February 11, 1790, two groups of Quakers entered the House of Representatives, then meeting in New York. They respectfully submitted a petition to the government for a <term>redress of rights</term>, which was a traditional right reaching far back into English constitutional history. The content of the petition, however, sparked a fierce debate on the floor of the First Congress. The persons who signed the controversial petition were calling on the federal government to ban the African slave trade.</para>
<para id="fs-idm244458384">Several members of Congress supported the petition. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts wished ‚Äúto see measures pursued by every nation to wipe off the indelible stain which the slave trade had brought upon all.‚Äù Thomas Scott of Pennsylvania asserted, ‚ÄúI look upon the slave trade as one of the most abominable things on earth.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm246491168">Southern representatives angrily rose to their feet to denounce the petition and question the patriotism of the pacifist Quakers, who had refused to fight in the War for Independence. James Jackson of Georgia (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_04_03_JJackson"/>) and William Loughton Smith of South Carolina attacked the petition and cited Article I, section 9, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, which specifically banned Congress from interfering with the slave trade until 1808. They also articulated a biblical defense of slavery and argued for the economic necessity of enslaved labor. Jackson feared that, ‚Äúif through the interference of the general government, the slave trade was abolished, it would evince to the people a general disposition toward a total emancipation.‚Äù</para>

<caption>James Jackson was a war hero during the American Revolution. While serving in Congress, he was a staunch defender of states‚Äô rights and slavery.</caption>

<para id="fs-idm240330944">The next day, a petition arrived from the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and its president, Benjamin Franklin. The octogenarian Franklin had accepted the presidency of the society shortly after returning from Europe, where he had negotiated the peace treaty ending the Revolutionary War. Now a world-renowned Enlightenment scientist and statesman, he had dedicated his lifetime of public service to the causes of liberty and civic virtue and had become a convert to the cause of antislavery. The year before, Franklin had signed a Society statement that declared slavery ‚Äúan atrocious debasement of human nature.‚Äù He had almost presented a petition from the society to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787 but withheld it. Now, he was courageously opening the question of slavery at the dawn of the new nation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm258684816">The petition was a model of equality and justice: ‚ÄúMankind are all formed by the same Almighty Being, alike objects of his care, and equally designed for the enjoyment of happiness.‚Äù All people were entitled to the ‚Äúblessings of liberty . . . without distinction of color.‚Äù It noted the contradiction of slavery and freedom in the American experiment while seeking the means ‚Äúfor removing this inconsistency from the character of the American people,‚Äù and it called on Congress to grant ‚Äúliberty to those unhappy men who alone in this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage.‚Äù It advocated not only the end of the slave trade, as the Quaker petition had the day before, but the end of slavery itself.</para>
<para id="fs-idm271380368">The petition was on solid grounds of justice but weaker on constitutional support for its case. Finding no clauses authorizing Congress to ban slavery, the society argued that Congress had the general grant of power in the general welfare and necessary and proper clauses. The House voted overwhelmingly to refer the petitions to a committee, over the objections of the South Carolina and Georgia delegations.</para>
<para id="fs-idm256784432">On March 5, the committee submitted its report to the House. Representative Jackson jumped to his feet and launched into a day-long <term>harangue</term> against the petitions. He declared that ‚Äúthe southern states must be left to themselves on this subject‚Äù and reiterated the arguments he had previously made. He admitted that slavery was an ‚Äúevil habit,‚Äù but one, he thought, that was sanctioned in the Bible and history. Smith followed Jackson the next day with a two-hour speech. Both personally attacked the Quakers‚Äô character and assailed Franklin as a senile fool. The Pennsylvanians defended Franklin for his dedication to the cause of liberty and equality for all. They thanked him for speaking the ‚Äúlanguage of America, and to call us back to our first principles.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm278729664">Jackson and Smith also argued that African Americans were ill-suited by nature for freedom and citizenship if emancipated. They warned of intermarriage between the races if enslaved persons were freed. Franklin (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_04_03_BFranklin"/>) anticipated these prejudiced arguments and reasoned that slavery debased the enslaved and ruined their natural intellectual equality. ‚ÄúThe galling chains that bind his body do also fetter his intellectual faculties and impair the social affections of his heart.‚Äù Therefore, Franklin advocated a plan of education for free blacks to train them in knowledge and virtue for good citizenship. The plan would ‚Äúinstruct, to advise, to qualify those who have been restored to freedom, for the exercise and enjoyment of civil liberty . . . [to] promote the public good, and the happiness of these our hitherto much neglected fellow [humans].‚Äù</para>

<caption>One of the most versatile of the Founders, Benjamin Franklin was an inventor, philosopher, philanthropist, writer, and statesman. This portrait of him was painted in 1767 and, as of 2019, hangs in the White House. The inclusion of books and the bust of Isaac Newton hint at Franklin‚Äôs interests.</caption>

<para id="fs-idm246469104">On March 23, the House voted to adopt the resolutions contained in the committee report, including one that prevented Congress from interfering with slavery where it already existed in the South, making tangible the Constitution‚Äôs silence on the issue. The humane petitions to end the slave trade and slavery had been received, but the debate ended with Congress endorsing slavery‚Äôs protected status in the new nation. The question was hardly settled, however, and seven decades of fierce debate over slavery and its expansion ensued.</para>
<para id="fs-idm254106256">Franklin responded to the conclusion of the controversy in his typical manner‚Äîhe wrote a biting satire. It took the form of a fictional speech by Muslim Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim of Algiers apologizing for piracy and Christian slavery in a way that mirrored the southern arguments. ‚ÄúIf we cease our cruises against the Christians, how shall we be furnished with the commodities their countries produce, and which are so necessary? . . . . Let us then hear no more of this detestable proposition, the manumission of Christian slaves.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm277949808">Franklin died only a few weeks later at the age of 84 years. He had spent a lifetime in service to the republic and to the universal ideal that all humans were created free and equal. His last act on the public stage was to submit a petition for the end of slavery and the slave trade. He and a few Quakers initiated the movement urging the new United States to live up to its Founding principles and end the stain of slavery.</para>
