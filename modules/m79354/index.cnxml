<para id="fs-idm292240864">The technological innovations of the cotton gin and weaving looms in early factories in Great Britain and New England led to the mass production of manufactured textiles. The worldwide demand for cotton soared, and the American South provided almost half that cotton, amounting to 400 million pounds by the 1820s. Southern planters and farmers had an insatiable desire for land on which they and their enslaved workers grew the lucrative crop. Tens of thousands of white southerners and their enslaved workers moved into Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The owners were guided by the idea of Manifest Destiny and believed they had a right to land that was supposedly unimproved by American Indians.</para>
<para id="fs-idm175459808">However, members of the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole nations lived on those lands in the Southeast. Whites called them the ‚ÄúFive Civilized Tribes‚Äù because they had adopted some of the cultural ways of whites, such as by using whites‚Äô methods of agriculture and animal husbandry, wearing whites‚Äô style of clothing, and attending English-speaking missionary schools. The Cherokee leader Sequoyah created a syllabary to write down stories from the Cherokee oral tradition, and the Cherokee adopted a republican constitution with a bicameral legislature and three branches of government. Still, the tribes were split over whether to follow this policy of cultural assimilation in which they gave up their traditional ways of living. They were also deeply divided over whether to cede land to whites after the War of 1812. Several treaties were made ceding tens of millions of acres in the southeastern states when Andrew Jackson and other negotiators appealed to those Indians who wanted to sell.</para>
<para id="fs-idm206857888">During the 1820s, Jackson and many southerners in Congress and state governments embraced a policy of removal of the American Indians living in the Southeast to west of the Mississippi River. Settlers and land speculators pressured all levels of government to support removal. The congressional House Committee on Indian Affairs considered a removal bill in 1825, but it died in committee. The removal policy coincided with proposals for a giant Indian reservation that would comprise different tribes. These also failed.</para>
<para id="fs-idm185577536">Jackson was another prominent supporter of Indian removal in the 1820s. He had fought in several battles against American Indians in the Southeast during and after the War of 1812. He also served as a treaty commissioner and persuaded tribes to surrender millions of acres of land. He and the southerners who later formed the nucleus of the emerging Democratic Party advocated removal.</para>
<para id="fs-idm165107552">In his first inaugural address as president in 1829, Jackson vaguely promised ‚Äúto observe toward the Indian tribes within our limits a just and liberal policy.‚Äù In his annual message to Congress that December, he summarized government policy much more extensively. Despite his view that the southeastern Indian nations had ‚Äúmade some progress in the arts of civilized life,‚Äù Jackson said, ‚ÄúI suggest for your consideration the propriety of setting apart an ample district west of the Mississippi, and without the limits of any state or territory now formed, to be guaranteed to the Indian tribes as long as they shall occupy it, each tribe having a distinct control over the portion designated for its use.‚Äù Removal to the West, he argued, was actually beneficial to ‚Äúpreserve this much-injured race.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm255945712">In February and March 1830, the debate in Congress over the Indian removal bill was acrimonious. Mostly northerners, influenced by the ideals of justice and Christian morals, submitted hundreds of petitions protesting the removal. New Jersey Senator Theodore Frelinghuysen delivered a three-day speech excoriating the removal policy as a violation of federal treaties and ‚Äúoppressive encroachments upon the sacred privileges of our Indian neighbors.‚Äù Georgia Senator John Forsyth retorted by defending removal as a matter of states‚Äô rights and declared that American Indians would be better off on western hunting grounds. The bill narrowly passed by a vote of 28 to 19 in the Senate and 102 to 97 in the House. Jackson signed it into law in late May. The act provided for voluntary removal to lands held by Indians in perpetuity west of the Mississippi provided they surrendered lands to the east. The federal government promised provisions and protection during the journey to the west.</para>
<para id="fs-idm225923408">The Choctaws were the first to sign a removal treaty in September, and some of the tribe began emigrating during a terrible winter without federal troops or adequate provisions. Hundreds perished during the journey, and the survivors straggled to their destination in small groups.</para>
<para id="fs-idm172812624">In the icy winter chill of a December day in 1831, French chronicler Alexis de Tocqueville (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_06_03_Tocquevill"/>) was present to witness the forlorn and destitute Choctaw cross the partially frozen Mississippi River. Tocqueville looked upon the injustice with mixed disgust and pity. Though he had come to the United States ostensibly to study its prison system, he had spent the majority of his time, instead, studying his real passion: the functions and trappings of the institutions of the first modern republic, which he believed represented the future of humanity. But the coerced removal of entire American Indian nations and the denial of their natural rights contradicted the ideals of American democracy. Tocqueville believed ‚Äúthe Indian race [was] doomed to perish.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm220139984">He described the scene:</para>
<quote id="fs-idm203914144">At the end of the year 1831, whilst I was on the left bank of the Mississippi at a place named by Europeans, Memphis, there arrived a numerous band of Choctaws (or Chactas, as they are called by the French in Louisiana). These savages had left their country, and were endeavoring to gain the right bank of the Mississippi, where they hoped to find an asylum which had been promised them by the American government. It was then the middle of winter, and the cold was unusually severe; the snow had frozen hard upon the ground, and the river was drifting huge masses of ice. The Indians had their families with them; and they brought in their train the wounded and sick, with children newly born, and old men upon the verge of death. They possessed neither tents nor wagons, but only their arms and some provisions. I saw 373 Tocqueville them embark to pass the mighty river, and never will that solemn spectacle fade from my remembrance. No cry, no sob was heard amongst the assembled crowd; all were silent. Their calamities were of ancient date, and they knew them to be irremediable. The Indians had all stepped into the bark which was to carry them across, but their dogs remained upon the bank. As soon as these animals perceived that their masters were finally leaving the shore, they set up a dismal howl, and, plunging all together into the icy waters of the Mississippi, they swam after the boat.</quote>

<para id="fs-idm173210832">Federal troops and private companies helped more than nine thousand Choctaws settle in Indian Territory by 1833 (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_06_03_FiveTribes"/>). However, the summers of 1832 and 1833 saw devastating outbreaks of cholera among the Choctaws. Thousands of them perished from the disease.</para>

<para id="fs-idm201460208">The other nations followed the Choctaws to the Indian Territory in the West throughout the 1830s and early 1840s. Secretary of War Lewis Cass was responsible for providing military protection and ensuring the tribes had adequate provisions and medical care through federal troops or private contractors. The Chickasaws decided to sign a treaty in 1832, and more than six thousand of the tribe emigrated by 1838. The Creeks resisted for a few more years, but the encroachment of an estimated ten thousand white settlers seeking land and gold without much hindrance from the federal government persuaded the Creeks to sign a treaty in 1834. When violence erupted in what were termed the First and Second Creek Wars, federal troops subdued the Creeks and forcibly removed three thousand of them, followed by thousands of others. By 1838, thousands of Creeks had died during removal.</para>
<para id="fs-idm203954592">The Cherokee stayed in Georgia and were harassed by the state government and private citizens who wanted their land. Chief John Ross refused to sign a removal treaty, but other chiefs were more willing and signed the Treaty of New Echota. Writer Ralph Waldo Emerson and Texan Sam Houston were among those who publicly denounced the treaty as a miscarriage of justice. It passed by a single vote in the Senate. In the fall of 1838 and the harsh winter that followed during the presidency of Martin Van Buren, the Cherokee were forcibly removed by federal troops. Private companies failed to deliver food and supplies, and about four thousand Cherokee died of starvation and disease during the journey along the ‚ÄúTrail of Tears.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm181695600">The Seminoles were victims of a fraudulent treaty some of the chiefs signed in 1832, so most the nation refused to leave Florida. A Creek named Osceola led a band of warriors who attacked and killed more than one hundred U.S. troops to start the Second Seminole War in December 1835. The two sides engaged in several battles, though the Seminoles retreated to the nearly impenetrable swamps of the Everglades from which they launched raids on neighboring forts. The war lasted several years, with more than one thousand casualties on each side from the fighting and diseases such as malaria. The U.S. Army fought bitterly to remove approximately four thousand Seminoles by force, but a truce was signed in 1842, allowing about five hundred to remain.</para>
<para id="fs-idm180899488">Within the first few years of arrival in what is now Oklahoma, the resettled American Indian population was decimated by cholera, malaria, smallpox, and influenza. ‚ÄúWe did not visit a house, wigwam, or camp,‚Äù wrote a distressed missionary, ‚Äúwhere we did not find more or less sickness, and in most instances the whole family were prostrated by disease. Great numbers of them have died.‚Äù The sickness hit the children hardest, and child death rates soared.</para>
<para id="fs-idm175887184">With similar results, the U.S. government forcibly removed the Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_06_03_TrailTears"/>). Twice, the Cherokee took their case to the U.S. Supreme Court. In <emphasis effect="italics">Cherokee Nation v. Georgia</emphasis> (1831), Marshall‚Äôs court ruled that the Cherokee constituted a ‚Äúdomestic dependent nation‚Äù and therefore had no standing to challenge Georgia‚Äôs sovereignty within Cherokee lands. A year later, in <emphasis effect="italics">Worcester v. Georgia</emphasis> (1832), the Marshall court ruled in the favor of the Cherokee, noting that Georgia, as a state, had no jurisdiction over independent and sovereign Indian nations. The Court thereby invalidated the Georgia laws claiming Cherokee lands because they were protected by federal treaty and the Commerce Clause of Article I, section 8.</para>
<para id="fs-idm227231888">The five American Indian nations of the southeast were dispossessed of their lands by white settlers and speculators, state governments, and the federal government. The treaties they had made respecting their lands were superseded by new treaties endorsing the idea of Indian removal and resettlement west of the Mississippi, supposedly forever. Nevertheless, within a few decades, the pressure of continued American migration to the West resulted in a series of Indian wars and additional injustices.</para>

<caption>At their peak, the Creek nation controlled land in the present-day states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. By 1836, most Creek had either relocated voluntarily or were forced to move to Indian Territory, as shown in a modern artist‚Äôs rendition of the Creek relocation.</caption>
