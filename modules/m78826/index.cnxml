<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm232060688">King George III issued The Royal Proclamation of 1763 (commonly referred to as the Proclamation of 1763) after Great Britain's victory in the French and Indian War. The proclamation outlawed settlement on Native American land west of the Appalachian Mountains. The proclamation was issued from London, England (no American Indians were consulted in its creation) and colonists were angered by this proclamation from afar. They continued their westward expansion into these lands despite the proclamation’s terms.</para>
<para id="fs-idm255543392">After the Revolutionary War, the new American government inherited the problem of reconciling a just policy toward American Indians and their citizens’ thirst for western expansion. The Creek Nation occupied extensive territory in what is today eastern Georgia, northern Florida, Alabama, and eastern Mississippi. After several failed negotiations, the leaders of the Creek, including Chief Alexander McGillivray, traveled to New York and signed the Treaty of New York. The treaty guaranteed Creek land as a sovereign foreign nation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm232093408">Georgians were angry that the treaty limited their western settlement, and they resented the federal government telling them what to do. Because the federal government did not have the troops to enforce the treaty, it was routinely violated.</para>
