<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm242957616">Joseph Plumb Martin of Connecticut eagerly joined the cause of the Revolution in 1776 at the age of fifteen years. He served in the Continental Army for almost seven years, keeping detailed diaries of his experiences. In 1830, the seventy-year-old Martin published <emphasis effect="italics">A Narrative of Some of the Adventures, Dangers, and Sufferings of a Revolutionary Soldier.</emphasis> Martin’s book provides abundant evidence of soldiers’ demonstration of the ideals of courage, initiative, self-reliance, persistence, and devotion to duty, and it paints a vivid picture of how callous civilians were toward the army. Martin wrote that many aging veterans felt most Americans just wanted to forget about the war and the sacrifices made for liberty. At the time, Martin’s memoir did not sell well. A first edition of Martin’s book was rediscovered in the 1950s and republished, providing a valuable firsthand account of his adventures and sufferings. In November 1777, with British forces firmly in control of Philadelphia, the Continental capital, Martin was among about 400 American soldiers defending nearby Fort Mifflin against a five-day British siege by more than 2,000 British troops and 250 ships.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Here ends the account of as hard and fatiguing a job, for the time it lasted, as occurred during the revolutionary war. <link target-id="fs-idm231745792">Thomas Paine, in one of his political essays, speaking of the siege and defence of [Fort Mifflin], says, “they had nothing but their bravery and good conduct to cover them.” He spoke the truth. . . . But there has been but little notice taken of it; the reason of which is, there was no Washington, Putnam, or Wayne there. Had there been, the affair would have been <emphasis effect="bold">extolled</emphasis> to the skies.</link> No, it was only a few officers and soldiers who accomplished it in a remote quarter of the army. Such circumstances and such troops generally get but little notice taken of them, do what they will. Great men get great praise, little men, nothing.

<entry valign="top" align="left">We arrived early in the morning, at a pretty village called Milltown or Mount-holly. . . . <link target-id="fs-idm254473600">I was as near starved with hunger, as ever I wish to be.</link> I strolled into a large yard . . . but I found nothing there to satisfy my hunger. But there was a barrel standing behind the door with some salt in it. Salt was as valuable as gold with the soldiers. I filled my pocket with it and went out. In the yard and about it was a plenty of geese, turkeys, ducks, and barn-door fowls; I obtained a piece of an ear of Indian corn, and seating myself on a pile of boards began throwing the corn to the fowls which soon drew a fine battalion of them about me, I might have taken as many as I pleased, but I took up one only, wrung off its head, dressed and washed it in the stream, seasoned it with some of my salt, and stalked into the first house that fell in my way, invited myself into the kitchen, took down the <emphasis effect="bold">gridiron</emphasis> and put my fowl to cooking upon the coals. <link target-id="fs-idm250396640">The women of the house were all the time going and coming to and from the room; they looked at me but said nothing.—"They asked me no questions and I told them no lies."</link> When my game was sufficiently broiled, I took it by the <emphasis effect="italics">hind</emphasis> leg and made my exit from the house with as little ceremony as I had made my entrance. When I got into the street I devoured it after a <emphasis effect="italics">very</emphasis> short grace and felt . . . refreshed. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">The troops marched again before day; <link target-id="fs-idm232762656">I had sadly sprained my ankle the day before, and it was much swelled. . . . I hobbled on as well as I could; the rain and travelling of the troops and baggage had converted the road into perfect <emphasis effect="bold">mortar</emphasis> and it was extremely difficult for me to make headway. . . .</link> We again turned into a wood for the night; the leaves and ground were as wet as water could make them. . . . We were forced by our old master, Necessity, to lay down and sleep if we could, with three others of our constant companions, Fatigue, Hunger and Cold.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Next morning we joined the grand army near Philadelphia . . . we were obliged to put us up huts by laying up poles and covering them with leaves; a capital shelter from winter storms. <link target-id="fs-idm239483456">Here we continued to fast; indeed we kept a continual <emphasis effect="bold">lent</emphasis> as faithfully as ever any of the most rigorous of the Roman Catholics did.</link> But there was this exception, we had no fish or eggs or any other substitute for our commons. Ours was a real fast, and depend upon it, we were sufficiently mortified.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">While we lay here there was a Continental thanksgiving ordered by Congress; and as the army had all the cause in the world to be particularly thankful, if not for being well off, at least, that it was no worse, we were ordered to participate in it. We had nothing to eat for two or three days previous, except what the trees of the fields and forests afforded us. But we must now have what Congress said—a <emphasis effect="bold">sumptuous</emphasis> thanksgiving to close the year of high living. . . . <link target-id="fs-idm235931504">Our country, ever mindful of its suffering army, opened her sympathizing heart so wide, upon this occasion, as to give us something to make the world stare. And what do you think it was, reader? . . . I will tell you: it gave each and every man <emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">half</emphasis> a <emphasis effect="italics">gill</emphasis></emphasis> of rice, and a <emphasis effect="italics">table spoon full</emphasis> of vinegar!!</link> After we had made sure of this extraordinary superabundant donation, we were ordered out to attend a meeting, and hear a sermon delivered upon the happy occasion. . . .</entry>

But hunger, nakedness and sore shins were not the only difficulties we had at that time to encounter;—we had hard duty to perform and little or no strength to perform it with. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm214970048">However, there was no remedy,—no alternative but this or <emphasis effect="bold">dispersion</emphasis>;—but dispersion, I believe, was not thought of,—at least, I did not think of it,—we had engaged in the defence of our injured country and were willing, nay, we were determined to persevere as long as such hardships were not altogether intolerable.</link> . . . But we were now absolutely in danger of perishing, and that too, in the midst of a plentiful country. We then had but little, and often nothing to eat for days together. . . .</entry>

Or had the enemy, strong and well provided as he then was, thought fit to pursue us, our poor <emphasis effect="bold">emaciated</emphasis> carcases must have “strewed the plain.” But a kind and holy Providence took more notice and better care of us than did the country in whose service we were wearing away our lives by piecemeal.</entry>
