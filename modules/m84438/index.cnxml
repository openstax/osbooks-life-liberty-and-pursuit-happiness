<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm196774864">One of the goals of the New Deal was to put as many unemployed Americans back to work as quickly as possible. Before the well-known Works Progress Administration (WPA) was created in 1935 to create jobs, a smaller, less-ambitious program called the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) was developed in 1934. PWAP hired thousands of unemployed artists to create paintings, murals, and crafts for government and public buildings. The government suggested these designers depict American life in their works.</para>
