<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm374954176">After the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson began to escalate the deployment of U.S. military forces to engage against North Vietnam. In February 1965, he ordered the start of Operation Rolling Thunder, a bombing campaign on North Vietnam that would grow over the next few years. Johnson hoped the bombing raids would demonstrate American commitment to its South Vietnamese ally. An increasing number of Americans expressed their disapproval of becoming involved in a war halfway around the world, and Johnson used the following speech to respond to these concerns and outline U.S. goals in Vietnam.</para>

</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Of course, some of the people of South Viet-Nam are participating in attack on their own government. But trained men and supplies, orders and arms, flow in a constant stream from north to south. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">The confused nature of this conflict cannot mask the fact that it is the new face of an old enemy.</entry>

<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Over this war—and all Asia—is another reality: the deepening shadow of Communist China. <link target-id="fs-idm522445776">The rulers in Hanoi are urged on by Peking</link>. This is a regime which has destroyed freedom in Tibet, which has attacked India, and has been condemned by the United Nations for aggression in Korea. It is a nation which is helping the forces of violence in almost every continent. The contest in Viet-Nam is part of a wider pattern of aggressive purposes.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Why are these realities our concern? Why are we in South Viet-Nam ?</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">We are there because we have a promise to keep. <link target-id="fs-idm343622304">Since 1954 every American President has offered support to the people of South Viet-Nam</link>. We have helped to build, and we have helped to defend. Thus, over many years, we have made a national pledge to help South Viet-Nam defend its independence.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">And I intend to keep that promise.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm495988992">To dishonor that pledge, to abandon this small and brave nation to its enemies, and to the terror that must follow, would be an unforgivable wrong.</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">We are also there to strengthen world order. Around the globe, from Berlin to Thailand, are people whose well-being rests, in part, on the belief that they can count on us if they are attacked. <link target-id="fs-idm387193968">To leave Viet-Nam to its fate would shake the confidence of all these people in the value of an American commitment and in the value of America’s word. The result would be increased unrest and instability, and even wider war.</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">We are also there because there are great stakes in the balance. Let no one think for a moment that retreat from Viet-Nam would bring an end to conflict. The battle would be renewed in one country and then another. The central lesson of our time is that the appetite of aggression is never satisfied. To withdraw from one battlefield means only to prepare for the next. We must say in southeast Asia—as we did in Europe—in the words of the Bible: “Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further.”</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">There are those who say that all our effort there will be futile—that China’s power is such that it is bound to dominate all southeast Asia. But there is no end to that argument until all of the nations of Asia are swallowed up.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">There are those who wonder why we have a responsibility there. Well, we have it there for the same reason that we have a responsibility for the defense of Europe. World War II was fought in both Europe and Asia, and when it ended we found ourselves with continued responsibility for the defense of freedom.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Our objective is the independence of South Viet-Nam, and its freedom from attack. We want nothing for ourselves—only that the people of South Viet-Nam be allowed to guide their own country in their own way.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm511877024">We will do everything necessary to reach that objective. And we will do only what is absolutely necessary.</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">In recent months attacks on South Viet-Nam were stepped up. Thus, it became necessary for us to increase our response and to make attacks by air. This is not a change of purpose. It is a change in what we believe that purpose requires.</entry>

</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">And we do this to convince the leaders of North Viet-Nam—and all who seek to share their conquest—of a very simple fact: We will not be defeated. <link target-id="fs-idm378483008">We will not grow tired</link>.</entry>

</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">We hope that peace will come swiftly. But that is in the hands of others besides ourselves. And we must be prepared for a long-continued conflict. It will require patience as well as bravery, the will to endure as well as the will to resist.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">futile</emphasis> (adj): pointless</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">I wish it were possible to convince others with words of what we now find it necessary to say with guns and planes: Armed hostility is <emphasis effect="bold">futile</emphasis>. Our resources are equal to any challenge. Because we fight for values and we fight for principles, rather than territory or colonies, our patience and our determination are unending.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">bondage</emphasis> (n): slavery</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">This war, like most wars, is filled with terrible irony. For what do the people of North Viet-Nam want? <link target-id="fs-idm386527008">They want what their neighbors also desire: food for their hunger; health for their bodies; a chance to learn; progress for their country; and an end to the <emphasis effect="bold">bondage</emphasis> of material misery</link>.
