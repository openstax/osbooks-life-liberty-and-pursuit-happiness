<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm385452864">In 1675, the Virginia colony was experiencing a great deal of tension between settlers and American Indians. Both sides engaged in fighting and retaliatory raids along the frontier because of disputed lands. Meanwhile, the colony was experiencing internal turmoil over increasing taxes, falling tobacco prices, increasing pressures to open more land for settlement, and growing questions over suspected corruption by long-term royal governor Sir William Berkeley. A recent wealthy migrant to the colony, Nathaniel Bacon, sat on the royal council. Bacon became a champion for the landless and poor when he urged the governor to send more armies against the American Indians. The colony split into factions supporting Bacon or Berkeley, who wished to avoid conflict with the American Indians in favor of stability and peace. Events soon descended into civil war: Rival armies fought each other and the capital, Jamestown, was burned. Order was only restored with the death of Bacon, the suppression of the rebellion, and the arrival of English troops.</para>
