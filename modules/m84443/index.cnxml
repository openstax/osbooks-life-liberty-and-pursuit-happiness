<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm239716928">World War II effectively began in Europe in September 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, leading to France and Britain declaring war on Germany. However, Hitler rapidly partitioned Poland with the Soviet Union. With his eastern borders safe, he then successfully invaded France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in May 1940, leaving Britain alone against the German war machine. Desperate for an ally, Britain began pressing the United States for assistance. In the summer of 1941, Prime Minister Winston Churchill met with President Franklin Roosevelt aboard a warship off the coast of Canada. Churchill hoped to convince the United States to join the war. Roosevelt refused to discuss this, but the two leaders did jointly release the Atlantic Charter. This agreement was not a treaty but a declaration of solidarity between the United States and Great Britain.</para>
