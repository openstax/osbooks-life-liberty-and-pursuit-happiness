<item>(<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_09_06_Puck"/>) How does Bryan’s speech and his distrust of eastern commercial interests compare with <emphasis effect="italics">Puck’s</emphasis> political cartoon?</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm328351920">Answer: The cartoon demonstrated that rural farmers needed to be aware of the potential damage from northern industrial interests. In addition, the railroads and industries did not have the farmers’ best interests in mind as they pursued profits. Both Bryan and the cartoonist would agree that “hard money” policies worked against rural farmers and were only supported by the major commercial factions. One major difference between the two might be that Bryan described rural citizens as resourceful and well-intentioned, whereas in the cartoon, the farmer appeared almost naïve and helpless.</para>

<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm355347408">After the Civil War ended in 1865, America’s industrial capacity generated large growth for decades. The country’s industrial centers were in the Northeast and the Great Lakes region. As industry boomed, a modern financial sector grew up to supply the nation’s growing business needs. Most of these banks and commercial centers were also in the northeastern states. As a result, western and southern farmers became frustrated with their poor economic position. In addition, their access to specie (i.e., hard currency) to pay their mounting debts from poor commodity prices and high shipping costs was limited by the nation’s adherence to the gold standard. As a result, concerned farmers turned to the federal government for redress and demanded action. In 1892, these farmers supported the Populist (or People’s) Party to achieve their ends, attaining remarkable success for a third party. In the 1896 presidential campaign, Populists supported Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan, a firebrand orator from Nebraska. At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, in 1896, Bryan delivered his most famous speech in which he decried the northern monied interests and their suppression of average Americans. In the final line, Bryan exclaimed that the American people would not allow rich industrialists to “crucify mankind upon a cross of gold,” a strong condemnation of the nation’s gold standard. The speech is one of the preeminent addresses in American political history because it illustrated the social, economic, and political tensions endemic to America throughout the Gilded Age.</para>
