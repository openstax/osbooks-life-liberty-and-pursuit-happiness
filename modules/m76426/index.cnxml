<para id="fs-idm210730416">This lesson acknowledges the main ideas and huge significance of the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and asks students to consider the process by which the compromises of the convention were achieved. It offers insight into the historian‚Äôs craft of interpreting history based on the clues left behind by those who lived though the event. Over the past several years, the Quill Project at Pembroke College, Oxford, has used data analysis to better understand the process of negotiation that resulted in the compromises of the Constitution. It is recommended that students are familiar with the context and figures involved at the Convention before participating in this activity.</para>

<para id="fs-idm247147856">Distribute <emphasis effect="bold">Handout A: Warm-Up Scenario and Reflection Questions</emphasis> to students. Allow students to answer the questions individually or discuss with a partner or small group. After a few minutes, call the class together and lead a brief class discussion on student responses and comments.</para>
<para id="fs-idm232084272">Transition the conversation to providing context for the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The delegates gathered in Philadelphia for an extremely important task but had no real rules or guidelines for how they would accomplish this task. In this activity, students will consider not only the momentous decisions reached by the delegates at the Constitutional Convention but also the process by which they debated, discussed, and, ultimately, compromised to create a document that has guided the United States for over 200 years.</para>

Your illustration should also indicate how the Quill Project‚Äôs work challenges the traditional historical narrative of the Convention‚Äôs work being a blend of the Virginia and New Jersey Plans.</para>
