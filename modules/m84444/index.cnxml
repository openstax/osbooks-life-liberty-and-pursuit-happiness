<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm475535472">In the minds of many Americans, World War II was a battle between the Allied forces of democracy and liberty against Nazi, Japanese, and Italian fascism, tyranny, and oppression. This conception of an ideological war helped boost the morale of many American citizens who believed they were fighting for the freedom of the world. However, many African Americans in the United States found it difficult to support the liberation of Europe and the Pacific when they were treated as second-class citizens at home. African Americans routinely experienced discrimination in their daily lives, including when they tried to find work at munitions factories. In addition, government agencies, including the military, were strictly segregated.</para>
<para id="fs-idm475741024">In early 1941, A. Philip Randolph, the head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, threatened to lead a peaceful march of 10,000 African Americans on Washington, DC, to demand an end to racial segregation in the government, especially the military, and to demand greater equality in the hiring practices of defense industries. He released the following statement to explain his purpose and goals. President Roosevelt quickly created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC), which sought to end discrimination in government hiring, to prevent a large-scale demonstration. Randolph canceled the march, but the FEPC had no power to make changes in the private sector. In addition, the military remained segregated until 1948.</para>
