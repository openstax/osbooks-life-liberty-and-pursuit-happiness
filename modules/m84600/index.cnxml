<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm757887040">The 2004 presidential election pitted incumbent Republican president George W. Bush against John Kerry, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. At the Democratic National Convention in July, Barack Obama, a relatively unknown candidate for U.S. Senate from Illinois, gave the keynote address and attracted national attention. In his speech, Obama told the story of his family and urged the nation to elect Senator Kerry. Senator Kerry lost the election to President George W. Bush, but Obama won a seat in the Senate. Senator Obama’s star continued to rise, culminating in his receiving the Democratic nomination for president in 2008. President Obama served two terms from January 2009 to January 2017.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deep[est] gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let’s face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. <link target-id="fs-idm465531536">His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant</link> [to the British].</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place; America which stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor he signed up for duty, joined Patton’s army and marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through <emphasis effect="bold">FHA</emphasis>, and [later] moved west [all the way to Hawaii] in search of opportunity.</entry>

<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two continents. <link target-id="fs-idm466026224">My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation</link>. They would give me an African name, Barack, or “blessed,” believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren’t rich, because in a generous America you don’t have to be rich to achieve your potential. They are both passed away now. Yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with [great] pride.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">[They stand here and] I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents’ dreams live on in my precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, <link target-id="fs-idm226454112">“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”</link></entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams of its people, the insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe or hiring somebody’s son. That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted—<link target-id="fs-idm507995472">or at least, most of the time</link>.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers, and the promise of future generations. And fellow Americans—Democrats, Republicans, Independents—I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. . . .</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">. . . The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks, they don’t expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don’t want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can’t teach kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can’t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. No, people don’t expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice. . . .</entry>

<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Now let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated. . . . It’s not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there’s another ingredient in the American saga.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">A belief that we are connected as one people. If there’s a child on the south side of Chicago who can’t read, that matters to me, even if it’s not my child. If there’s a senior citizen somewhere who can’t pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it’s not my grandmother. If there’s an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It’s that fundamental belief—I am my brother’s keeper, I am my sisters’ keeper—that makes this country work. It’s what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. <link target-id="fs-idm201323232">“<emphasis effect="italics">E pluribus unum</emphasis>.” Out of many, one</link>.</entry>
</row>
<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America—there’s the United States of America. There’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I’ve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don’t like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. <link target-id="fs-idm447220256">We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.</link></entry>

Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope?</link> John Kerry calls on us to hope. <emphasis effect="bold">John Edwards</emphasis> calls on us to hope. I’m not talking about blind optimism here—the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don’t talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I’m talking about something more substantial. It’s the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of <emphasis effect="bold">a young naval lieutenant</emphasis> bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a <emphasis effect="bold">mill worker’s son</emphasis> who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.

<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">bedrock</emphasis> (n): foundational principles</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">In the end, that is God’s greatest gift to us, the <emphasis effect="bold">bedrock</emphasis> of this nation; the belief in things not seen; the belief that there are better days ahead. I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. America!</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Tonight, if you feel the same energy I do, the same urgency I do, the same passion I do, the same hopefulness I do—if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come. Thank you and God bless you.</entry>
