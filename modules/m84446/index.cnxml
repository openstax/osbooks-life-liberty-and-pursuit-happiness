<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm229729024">The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II. The United States had already been using its industrial might to be the “arsenal of democracy” by sending equipment and munitions to nations fighting the Axis powers. However, the nation would now need to continue to produce enough war supplies for its allies as well as itself. In addition, millions of men left their work at factories, mines, shipyards, and other industries to join the military. The many job openings provided an opportunity unprecedented in U.S. history for women to find work outside of their home. Many women wanted to work or were already working at low-paying jobs and wanted higher wages.</para>
