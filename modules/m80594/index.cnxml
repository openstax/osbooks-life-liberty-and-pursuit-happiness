<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm184025056">Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, Romanticism had a profound influence on music, literature, and art. Romanticism recognized the significance of emotions, the individual, and nature, and it sought to establish links among them. Romantic artists recognized that in painting landscapes, they could convey their feelings regarding a variety of issues, including the fragility of the natural landscape, the encroachment of industry and technology, and the future of the American people. Perhaps the most celebrated group of landscape painters to emerge during the Romantic era was the Hudson River School. This group, which included artists Thomas Cole, Samuel Colman, James McDougal Hart, and Frederic Edwin Church, was based in New York City but ventured up the Hudson Valley and painted the breathtaking scenery they encountered along the way. Other members of this school, such as Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Moran, journeyed westward and visited mountainous regions, including the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Their work is sometimes classified in a separate school known as the Rocky Mountain School. Unlike previous generations of American artists who copied the artistic subjects of English and Italian art by painting scenes of Europe, the Hudson River School and Rocky Mountain School painted American subjects. These American artists made a radical break from the traditional path of going to study in England or Italy. Thomas Cole, who is considered the founder of the Hudson River School, summed up his feelings about the importance of landscape painting in his “Essay on American Scenery,” a portion of which is provided here.</para>
