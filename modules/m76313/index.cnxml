<title>I. Warm-up Activity (10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm256755904">1. Students should answer the following question on <emphasis effect="bold">Handout A: QFT Notes and Reflections</emphasis> individually: How do historians use questions?</para>
<para id="fs-idm260606480">2. Ask students to volunteer their responses in a whole-group discussion. Students should understand that historians use questions to drive their inquiry or research into particular topics or arguments and can question historical events, peoples‚Äô actions, and/or the effect of these experiences. Students can be asked follow-up questions such as:</para>

<title>II. Exploration (20 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm264563920">1. Students will participate in an exercise known as the Question Formulation Technique, or the QFT<sup>¬Æ</sup>. The QFT is designed to encourage students to ask their own questions, pique their interest in a subject, and build confidence in their historical thinking skills. Explain to students that they will be using the QFT today, which means they will be formulating questions on the basis of a prompt that will appear on the next slide, known as the QFocus. Have students read the four rules to the QFT aloud, which should be posted on the board:</para>
<list id="fs-idm254685424" list-type="bulleted">
<item>Ask as many questions as you can.</item>
<item>Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss any questions.</item>
<item>Change any statement into a question.</item>
<item>Write down every question exactly as stated.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm261371952">Explain to students that these are the only rules they must follow in this process. Engage students in a discussion about these rules:</para>
<list id="fs-idm259637184" list-type="bulleted">
<item>What are you going to be doing during this activity?</item>
<item>What will be challenging about following these rules?</item>
<item>Which rule will be most difficult to follow?</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm259998752">2. When students are clear on the directions, divide students into groups of two or three and assign each group to a piece of chart paper. The group should nominate a recorder to record questions from all group members. When all groups are ready, show the QFocus: the map of pre-Columbian Native American settlement and the map of British, French, and Spanish colonies in 1750.</para>
<para id="fs-idm237790560">3. Allow students to ask questions for about 15 minutes without interruption. If students seem to be slowing down or checking out of the activity, remind students of the rules or ask them to repeat a certain rule (i.e., if they make an observation to a peer instead of asking a question, ask the student to read rule 3: ‚ÄúChange any statement into a question.‚Äù). Monitor students; when most groups have a full piece of chart paper, give students a one-minute warning.</para>

<title>III. Application (15‚Äì20 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm268342992">1. Ask students to step back from their poster and read over the questions they generated as a group. Students should label their closed- and open-ended questions with a ‚Äúc‚Äù or ‚Äúo.‚Äù</para>
<list id="fs-idm257583808" list-type="bulleted">
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Closed-ended</emphasis> questions have one specific answer (i.e., ‚ÄúWhat year did the British come to North America?‚Äù)</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Open-ended</emphasis> questions have many answers or require a lengthy response (i.e., ‚ÄúWhy did the British come to North America?‚Äù)</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm272543968">2. Ask students what the value is in asking each kind of question. Students should then change one open-ended question into a closed-ended question and vice versa.</para>
<para id="fs-idm268279840">3. Each student should then select three priority questions‚Äîthree questions that they most want to know the answer to. Students do not have to agree as a group and can mark these with different symbols, colors, or their initials on the chart paper. Students should record these questions on <emphasis effect="bold">Handout A: QFT Notes and Reflections</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm278340272">4. Move around the room, asking each student to quickly share his or her top priority question with the whole group.</para>
