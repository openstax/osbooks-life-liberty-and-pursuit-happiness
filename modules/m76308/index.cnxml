<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm275757408">Hernán Cortés arrived in what is now Mexico in 1519. He was sent by the Spanish king Charles V to explore more of the Caribbean territories, search for gold and other resources, and claim this land in the name of the king. In 1520, he and approximately three hundred men traveled to the interior of Mexico to the mighty Aztec Empire, which was ruled by King Montezuma II. Eventually, he was brought to the capital of this empire, Tenochtitlan, which is today known as Mexico City. This city was home to approximately twenty million people. By 1521, however, Cortés and his three hundred men managed to bring this great city under Spanish control. Cortés documented his two years in Mexico to his benefactor, King Charles V, in a series of letters.</para>
