<para id="fs-idm400230560">The works of art included in this lesson can be displayed in a variety of ways as best suits your classroom and teaching situation. The artwork can be presented using a projector and the lesson can be done as a large class discussion. Alternatively, small groups can be assigned one high-quality color print of each work of art to interpret and share with the class as a jigsaw activity. Or, each piece of art can be printed and hung around the room or in a large space where students move around the room to interpret each, then come together for debriefing at the end. Seven works of art are provided, but not all need to be used in the lesson. This lesson is based on the ‚ÄúSee, Think, Wonder‚Äù thinking routine from Project Zero.</para>

<title>I. Warm-up Activity (5‚Äì10 min, depending on student responses)</title>
<para id="fs-idm405873728">Invite students to share with a partner a picture they have taken recently on their phone. Have the partner interpret the picture by asking them what they see and what they think. Ask students to consider what the picture reveals about the subject and the audience.</para>
<para id="fs-idm399392704">If students are not allowed technology in your classroom, provide students with an image of your choosing that can be silly or serious, depending on your teaching situation and class needs. Follow the same guided prompts provided.</para>

<title>II. Exploration (25‚Äì30 min)</title>
<list id="fs-idm398287680" list-type="bulleted">
<item>Tell students that art is a primary source and, like text-based documents, can reveal much about the time from which it came, the ‚Äúauthor‚Äù (artist) and the intended audience: In this activity, they will look at various depictions of George Washington in art to write both a comparative and a change and continuity thesis statement.</item>
<item>Model the thinking routine used for this lesson with students by looking at the <emphasis effect="italics">Apotheosis of Washington</emphasis> fresco as a class. Give students one to two minutes to look without talking, asking them to carefully observe and make note of all the details that strike them. If they struggle, show the detail from the fresco‚Äôs focal point of Washington with two women.</item>
<item>Ask students to share what they see (e.g., angels, thirteen women, Washington in the sky, clouds.</item>
<item>Ask students next to consider what this work of art makes them think. Invite students to share responses. Encourage students to support their interpretation with reasons to make their thinking visible (e.g., ‚ÄúI think the artist thought Washington was a god <emphasis effect="italics">because he is in the clouds between two women that look like goddesses and there are angels all around</emphasis>.‚Äù).</item>
<item>Ask students to share what they wonder after looking at this art (e.g., When was this painted? Why was it painted? Why do some of the angels have their back to the viewer?).</item>
<item>Use the <emphasis effect="bold">Instructor Answer Guide</emphasis> to reveal key details of the painting that will deepen the students understanding of this source.</item>
<item>Have students work in pairs or trios to apply the thinking routine used in the warm-up to each of the other images of George Washington.</item>

<para id="fs-idm404370192">Invite students to come back together after looking at the images of Washington to synthesize the content by leading a class discussion of the following questions. Students may orally respond to each question or write their responses, as best fits your needs.</para>
<para id="fs-idm401198848">1. What common themes did you see in these depictions of Washington?</para>
