<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm363250672">The antebellum period before the Civil War witnessed rapid population and economic growth and several reform movements aimed at improving lives and fulfilling the principles of the American republic. The United States also experienced contention and deep divisions as slavery and the expansion of territory challenged the political balance of power in the nation. The national debate over slavery and its expansion was at the root of the sectional tensions that, despite the efforts of many, led to the Civil War.</para>

<title>Texas, the Mexican War, and Slavery‚Äôs Expansion</title>
<para id="fs-idm349716080">In the two decades after it was adopted in 1820, the Missouri Compromise promised that virtually all the republic‚Äôs future expansion westward would be secured from slavery. In fact, however, the compromise only deflected the energies of westward expansion south-westward to the old Spanish domains, where Mexican revolutionaries (following the American example) had overthrown their colonial overlords and created a Mexican Republic in 1823. Achieving political stability proved more difficult for Mexico than for the United States, and in a bid to promote development, the new Mexican government encouraged American immigrants to settle in the northernmost province of Texas in the 1820s. Mexico soon regretted the decision. American settlers arrived in alarming numbers‚Äîsome 20,000 by the end of the decade‚Äîand showed no inclination to either assimilate themselves to Mexican culture or obey Mexican laws banning slavery. In 1835, these <term><emphasis effect="italics">nordamericanos</emphasis></term> rose in revolt, and after a gallant but bloody defeat at the Alamo in March 1836, they won a resounding victory over Mexican general Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna at San Jacinto on April 21, 1836 (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_07_02_Alamo"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm325257232">Texas proclaimed itself an independent republic, which Mexico refused to recognize diplomatically. But Texans‚Äô hopes were on annexation by the United States. President Martin Van Buren ought to have been a friend of annexation: he was the handpicked successor of Andrew Jackson, and Jackson‚Äôs Democrats had always been eager to promote westward expansion, especially if it served the interests of southern slaveholders, who filled their ranks. But opposition to westward land grabs and the growth of slavery had already contributed to the creation of the Whig Party, headed by Henry Clay. Besides, Texas had run up substantial debt in its war with Mexico, and the United States, then in the throes of a deep economic recession, was not eager to add to the nation‚Äôs bills.</para>
<para id="fs-idm329292368">However, in 1844, another Jackson prot√©g√©, James Knox Polk of Tennessee, narrowly defeated Henry Clay for the presidency. Polk was dedicated to the ideal of Manifest Destiny and put fresh wind in the sails of expansion. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80583">To What Extent Were Manifest Destiny and Westward Expansion Justified?</link> Point-Counterpoint and the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80597">Art Analysis: <emphasis effect="italics">American Progress</emphasis> by John Gast, 1872</link> Primary Source.) Not only was Texas annexed but Polk agitated for the acquisition of still more Mexican territory in the southwest‚ÄîNew Mexico, California‚Äîand demanded border readjustments to the north, along the line dividing Oregon from British Canada. As Democratic journalist John L. O‚ÄôSullivan wrote in 1845, it was ‚Äúour manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.‚Äù (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80585">John O‚ÄôSullivan, ‚ÄúAnnexation,‚Äù 1845</link> Primary Source.) Polk took this idea to heart, starting with congressional annexation of Texas in 1845. After Mexico protested that it would never recognize the annexation, Polk stationed federal troops at Texas‚Äôs southern border. Ten months later, there was a border skirmish, and Polk used it as the pretext for war with Mexico. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80587">Debating the Mexican-American War, May 1846</link> Primary Source and the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80639">To Go to War with Mexico?</link> Decision Point.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm317351024">U.S. naval and land forces occupied New Mexico and California over only modest opposition. An invasion of northern Mexico by U.S. forces under General Zachary Taylor produced a major victory over a Mexican army commanded by Santa Anna at Buena Vista, and a daring thrust into central Mexico by General Winfield Scott, following the old route of the Spanish conquistadors, succeeded in capturing the capital, Mexico City, on September 13, 1847. The dejected Mexican government signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo the following February, conceding the annexation of Texas and surrendering New Mexico and California (including the modern states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada) to the United States. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m80568">The American Southwest: Tucson in Transition</link> Narrative.) Given that most of this Mexican Cession lay below the Missouri Compromise line of 36¬∞30‚Ä≤, the real winners of the war seemed to be southern slaveholders, who now saw a new empire for slavery‚Äôs expansion opening at their feet (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_07_02_USExpand"/>). As one American officer, Ulysses Grant, later wrote in disgust, the war was really nothing but ‚Äúa conspiracy to acquire territory out of which slave states might be formed for the American Union.‚Äù</para>

<title>The Compromise of 1850 and the ‚ÄúPopular Sovereignty‚Äù Doctrine</title>
<para id="fs-idm335131104">But the destiny of the Mexican Cession was by no means so manifest in Congress. The war with Mexico had hardly begun in the summer of 1846 before a Pennsylvania Representative, David Wilmot, proposed an amendment to an appropriations bill that would require ‚Äúas an express and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory from the Republic of Mexico‚Äù that ‚Äúneither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime.‚Äù The <term>Wilmot Proviso</term> was angrily countered by South Carolina‚Äôs pro-slavery senator John C. Calhoun. Calhoun argued that any territory won from Mexico was the ‚Äúcommon property‚Äù of all the states, and therefore open for slaveholders to migrate to‚Äîwith their slaves. Yet another proposal came from a northern Democratic senator, Lewis Cass, who urged that the slavery question be ‚Äúleft to the people‚Ä¶in their respective local governments‚Äù who would actually settle in the Cession and should have the final say by ‚Äú<term>popular sovereignty</term>.‚Äù President Polk favored a simple extension of the Missouri Compromise line, all the way to the Pacific Ocean (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_07_02_MisComp"/>). But Polk failed, both in mustering support for such an extension and in reconciling any of the other factions, and he left office in 1848 to be followed by a Whig president, the Mexican War hero Zachary Taylor.</para>

<para id="fs-idm307663344">Although Taylor was a southerner and a slaveholder himself, he was convinced that Congress should never ‚Äúpermit a state made from [the Mexican Cession] to enter our Union with the features of slavery connected with it.‚Äù The discovery of significant deposits of gold at Sutter‚Äôs Mill in California had triggered a massive gold rush and the influx of enough emigrants to justify the direct admission of California without an intervening territorial phase. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m80570">The 49ers</link> Narrative, the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80591">Dame Shirley (Mrs. Clappe), Letters from a Western Pioneer, 1851‚Äì1852</link> Primary Source, and the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80592">Frank Lecouvreur, <emphasis effect="italics">From East Prussia to the Golden Gate</emphasis>, 1851‚Äì1871</link> Primary Source.) Taylor used this to push California‚Äôs admission as a free state in 1850. Defusing the confrontation in Congress now fell to the master compromiser, Senator Henry Clay, who constructed yet another great national compromise, this time limiting future admissions of states from the Mexican Cession to Senator Cass‚Äôs popular sovereignty rule. Clay sweetened the deal for southerners by adding a tough new Fugitive Slave Act, giving federal assistance for the recapture of runaway slaves. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m80582">The Compromise of 1850</link> Decision Point.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm377432480">The real star of the effort behind Clay‚Äôs Compromise of 1850 was the Democratic junior senator from Illinois, Stephen A. Douglas, who had engineered the passage of the compromise‚Äôs components one by one. As early as 1852, Douglas was already being talked about as a possible Democratic presidential candidate. Although the nomination in that year went instead to the Mexican War veteran Franklin Pierce (who easily defeated the Whig candidate from the Mexican War, Winfield Scott), Douglas was emerging as the most powerful man in the Senate. Moreover, his success in passing the Compromise of 1850 convinced him that popular sovereignty was the key to solving the whole slavery conundrum. Douglas was irritated that slaveholders dissatisfied with the compromise and popular sovereignty were successfully blocking legislation for the organization of the old Louisiana Purchase territories of Kansas and Nebraska, both still governed by the no-slavery agreement of the Missouri Compromise. Brimming with confidence in the idea of popular sovereignty, he introduced legislation in January 1854 that repealed the Missouri Compromise and instead proposed to organize Kansas and Nebraska on the basis of popular sovereignty.</para>
<para id="fs-idm328285824">In the words of Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln, Douglas‚Äôs Kansas-Nebraska Act left many Americans ‚Äúthunderstruck and stunned; and we reeled and fell in utter confusion.‚Äù Northerners in the free states had assumed, a little too readily, that not even popular sovereignty would be enough to promote the use of slaves in the arid wastes of New Mexico, while the protections of the Missouri Compromise would secure the old Louisiana Purchase territories for free labor forever. That assurance was now cruelly ripped away. ‚ÄúBut we rose, each fighting,‚Äù Lincoln recounted, ‚Äúgrasping whatever he could first reach‚Äîa scythe‚Äîa pitchfork‚Äîa chopping axe, or a butcher‚Äôs cleaver‚Äù‚Äîanything with which to oppose Kansas-Nebraska and the popular sovereignty doctrine. Free Soilers, led by Salmon Chase of Ohio and Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, accused Douglas of advancing a shadowy conspiracy they called ‚Äúthe Slave Power,‚Äù which aimed at nothing less than legalizing slavery everywhere in the United States. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m80569">The Free Soil Party</link> Narrative.) The Kansas-Nebraska bill passed anyway, with Democratic president Franklin Pierce supporting it, but the outrage of some Democratic members of Congress remained.</para>
<para id="fs-idm392154064">In fact, that anger was stoked by another of Douglas‚Äôs creations, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. This statute put new strength into federal enforcement of the capture and extradition of runaway slaves in the North (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_07_02_SlaveAct"/>). In the process, however, it also created sensational showdowns between fugitive slaves and their trackers, sometimes resulting in deadly shootouts, and at other times in disgraceful recaptures of formerly enslaved individuals who had blended peacefully into northern society for years. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80589">Fugitive Slave Act, 1850</link> Primary Source and the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80572">Thomas Sims and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</link> Narrative.)</para>

<title>Abolitionists and Republicans</title>
<para id="fs-idm374443120"><term>Abolitionist</term> was a word few northerners had used to describe themselves before the 1850s; it applied only to a small band of uncompromising opponents of slavery who demanded the immediate and unconditional liberation of all slaves. Their rhetoric was radical. For example, William Lloyd Garrison, an abolitionist leader and editor of the most prominent abolitionist journal, <emphasis effect="italics">The Liberator</emphasis>, accused the Constitution of complicity with slavery and publicly burned a copy of it with the declaration that it was ‚Äúa covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.‚Äù (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80586">William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass on Abolition, 1845‚Äì1852</link> Primary Source.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm386296176">The Fugitive Slave Act began to change northerners‚Äô hesitation about abolition, and it changed them still more after June 1851, when the antislavery newspaper <emphasis effect="italics">National Era</emphasis> began serializing a new novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe entitled <emphasis effect="italics">Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin: or, Life Among the Lowly</emphasis>. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80573">Harriett Beecher Stowe and <emphasis effect="italics">Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin</emphasis></link> Narrative.) Stowe, who came from a religious and reform-oriented family, not only depicted the operation of the Fugitive Slave Act in the most lurid colors but also dramatized how easily southern blacks could be sold, beaten, raped, and even killed by their masters, with no particular legal consequences. When <emphasis effect="italics">Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin</emphasis> was released in book form in 1852, about 3,000 copies were sold on its first day. Together, the Fugitive Slave Act, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and <emphasis effect="italics">Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin</emphasis> made the political gap between the free states of the North and the slave states of the South almost unbridgeable (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_07_02_UncleTom"/>).</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm369434240">The first casualty of this polarization was the Whig Party, which collapsed into quarrelling northern and southern factions, with most of the southern Whigs merging into the Democratic Party. Some northern Whigs blamed their party‚Äôs troubles on rising tides of Catholic immigrants from Europe, who seemed willing to trade votes for the ‚ÄúSlave Power‚Äù for political favors, and they attached themselves to a short-lived anti-immigrant American Party (or ‚ÄúKnow-Nothings,‚Äù so called from the party members‚Äô pledge to respond to investigators with ‚ÄúI know nothing‚Äù). (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80575">Nativist Riots and the Know-Nothing Party</link> Narrative.) But the majority of northern Whigs (among them Abraham Lincoln) merged instead with disenchanted antislavery Democrats and abolitionists in a new northern antislavery party, the Republicans. In earlier years, the national constituencies of Whigs and Democrats had helped damp down sectional animosities. Now, the parties were becoming the mouthpieces of the country‚Äôs two sections, with each section increasingly behaving as though it saw no alternative but to go its own way.</para>
<para id="fs-idm379341712">Other casualties were human. If popular sovereignty was now to determine the future of Kansas and Nebraska as free or slave states, then it was up to antislavery and proslavery emigrants to move there and capture that sovereignty by numbers. As they did so, they inevitably clashed, and the clashes turned bloody. On May 24, 1856, a radical abolitionist named John Brown, with four of his sons and two of his neighbors, hacked five unarmed proslavery Kansans to death along Pottawatomie Creek before going underground to escape the law. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80576">Kansas-Nebraska Act and Bleeding Kansas</link> Narrative.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm378546160">Other events in the mid-1850s contributed to growing sectional tensions. In the fall of 1854, three of President Pierce‚Äôs diplomats‚ÄîJames Buchanan, Pierre Soule, and James Mason‚Äîformulated the Ostend <term>Manifesto</term>, describing how the United States could extend its expansionist arms into the Caribbean and annex Cuba as a new slave state. At almost the same time, John Brown launched his raid at Pottawatomie Creek, a southern member of Congress, Preston Brooks, accosted Republican leader and abolitionist Charles Sumner on the floor of the Senate and beat him senseless with a cane. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80577">Charles Sumner and Preston Brooks</link> Narrative.) On March 6, 1857, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Roger Brooke Taney, a southerner backed by a southern majority of justices, issued a decision in the case of <term><emphasis effect="italics">Dred Scott v. Sandford</emphasis></term>. Dred Scott was an enslaved person living in Missouri who was suing for his freedom because he had lived on free soil for a time. Taney‚Äôs decision declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional because Congress could not regulate slavery in the territories. It struck down even the requirement that there must be some expression of popular sovereignty before a territory could decide about slavery. Now, in effect, no territory could ban slavery. The Court‚Äôs decision also asserted that African Americans were not and could not become citizens of the United States. Taney believed the decision would calm sectional divisions over slavery, but, in fact, it inflamed them.

<para id="fs-idm368916960">Each of these steps only convinced northerners that ever-stronger antislavery steps needed to be taken, if not to abolish slavery (as the abolitionists wanted) then at least to contain its spread. Northerners did not lack for means. In 1858, Abraham Lincoln challenged Stephen A. Douglas for his seat in the U.S. Senate, and although Douglas enjoyed the advantage of public recognition, Lincoln quickly closed that gap by pressing relentlessly on the flaws in Douglas‚Äôs popular sovereignty doctrine.</para>
<para id="fs-idm364696480">For instance, when was a territory to schedule the vote on legalizing slavery by which its residents‚Äô popular sovereignty would be recorded? Halfway through the process of statehood? What would keep slaveholders from stuffing the territory‚Äîand the ballot-boxes‚Äîwith proslavery votes? If the vote went against legalization, how could the slaveholders in that territory be legally evicted? Above all, how could a mere vote take away from an enslaved human being the natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that the Declaration of Independence had declared were inalienable? ‚ÄúAs I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master,‚Äù Lincoln wrote on August 1, 1858, in a note for the debates. ‚ÄúThis expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy.‚Äù Although Lincoln lost the election because of the state‚Äôs system of voting <term>apportionment</term>, the seven open-air debates he held with Douglas deeply damaged Douglas‚Äôs career as a national political leader and brought Lincoln national attention (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_07_02_Lincoln"/>).

<para id="fs-idm368682800">Other northerners were growing more impatient. In October 1859, John Brown and a small band of abolitionist recruits stormed the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, hoping to seize the weapons stored there and spark a slave uprising in the western Virginia mountains (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_07_02_Harpers"/>). The raid was badly bungled, and Brown and his supporters were either killed or hanged for treason. But across the North, a man who in earlier years would have been scorned as a madman was now hailed as a martyr. ‚ÄúHe is a man to make friends wherever on earth courage and integrity are esteemed,‚Äù said the poet Ralph Waldo Emerson in a tribute to Brown, ‚Äúthe rarest of heroes, a pure idealist, with no by-ends of his own.‚Äù (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80600">John Brown: Hero or Villain?

Despite a major economic downturn in 1857 and 1858, which hurt the North far more than the South, the free states had 1,125 banks in operation, whereas the slave South had only 297; the North had built 18,123 miles of railroads, whereas the South had only 6,630. The public budgets of the slave states amounted to only a quarter of those of the free states. Above all, the population of the northern states had been gradually outpacing the South‚Äôs for decades. In 1840, the population of the free states stood at 9.6 million, and the slave states‚Äô free population at 4.8 million. By 1850, however, the North experienced a dramatic increase of population, fueled largely by immigration from Ireland and Germany, which were experiencing severe famine and political unrest. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80598">Irish and German Immigration DBQ</link> Lesson.) The free-state population had grown to 13.4 million, while in the slave states, the free population had increased only to 6.4 million. If antislavery northerners could unite behind a reasonable antislavery candidate for the presidency, they would be able to elect such a candidate purely on the strength of the northern states‚Äô electoral votes, and thus they could finally check the path of southern <term>belligerence</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm359854384">The North found such a candidate in Abraham Lincoln, who won the Republican presidential nomination in May 1860. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m80579">The Election of 1860</link> Narrative.) Lincoln was not an abolitionist. He believed the states had the responsibility for ending slavery and promised the South that as president he would have no authority over slavery. He favored emancipation, but only on a gradual timetable and with some form of national legislation and compensation for slaveholders, and he always insisted that he wanted to curtail slavery‚Äôs expansion into the territories more than anything else.</para>
<para id="fs-idm369201424">All that southerners heard, however, was that Lincoln opposed slavery, and then they handicapped themselves by refusing to endorse the Democratic Party‚Äôs favorite, Stephen Douglas. No longer content with Douglas‚Äôs popular sovereignty, southern Democrats wanted national slavery legislation and the acquisition of new foreign territory for expanding slavery‚Äôs domain, and they split the Democratic Party by nominating a southern proslavery candidate, John C. Breckinridge. Former southern Whigs who wanted to avoid the slavery issue and avert secession organized the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell from Tennessee. With Democrats thus divided between Douglas and Breckinridge and southerners divided between Democrats and the Constitutional Union Party, Lincoln coasted to an easy victory on November 6, 1860. Although he actually won only 39.8 percent of the popular vote (1,865,000 votes), he garnered almost all those votes in northern states with large populations and, therefore, won a lopsided Electoral College majority of 180 of 303 votes.</para>
<para id="fs-idm341199152">Southerners understood that this election signaled they had lost control of the political process. On November 12, the South Carolina state legislature called for a state convention to authorize secession from the United States, which it did on December 20. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m80596">South Carolina Secession Debate, 1860</link> Lesson.) By February 1, 1861, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas had quickly followed. Last-minute compromise efforts were made in Congress, first by Kentucky‚Äôs senior senator, John J. Crittenden, whom many saw as the heir of Henry Clay in working out compromises, and then by a Peace Convention that met in Washington in February. But the secessionists, who had organized themselves into a new Confederate States of America, were interested not in compromise but in taking possession of federal property within their boundaries, including the military installations at Ft. Pickens in Florida and Ft. Sumter in South Carolina. President-elect Lincoln refused to sanction the compromises in any case. The nation was about to tip over into the abyss of civil war. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m80601">The Election of Lincoln and the Secession of Southern States DBQ</link> Lesson.)</para>
