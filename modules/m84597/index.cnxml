<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm918489904">Maya Angelou was a celebrated author and poet, best known for her seven autobiographies. Angelou also worked as a civil rights activist with both Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X; at other times in her life she worked as a journalist, professor and historian, playwright, producer, director, and actress. In 1993, Angelou <link url="https://openstax.org/l/99MayAngPoem">delivered her poem “On the Pulse of Morning” at the inauguration</link> of President Clinton. Only two other poets have written and recited poetry for a presidential inaugural: Robert Frost in 1960 at the inauguration of President Kennedy and Richard Blanco at the 2013 inauguration of President Obama. Angelou remains the only woman and the only African American to have held such an honor. Angelou’s poem “On the Pulse of Morning” is written in free verse and contains many influences, including the poetry of Walt Whitman (see the Chapter 7 <link class="target-chapter" document="m80638">Walt Whitman, <emphasis effect="italics">Leaves of Grass</emphasis>, 1855</link> Primary Source), Negro spirituals (see the Chapter 7 <link class="target-chapter" document="m80637">Negro Spirituals</link> Primary Source), and the music of Bob Dylan. The poem uses the image of a rock, river, and tree to put forth a message of inclusiveness and hope.</para>
