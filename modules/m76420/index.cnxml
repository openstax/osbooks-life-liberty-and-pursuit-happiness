<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm227536160">The Articles of Confederation was the first constitution of the United States. Sent to the states for ratification in November of 1777, it established a confederation government that consisted of thirteen sovereign states and a limited central government. The Articles were ratified in 1781 and remained the governing document for the nation until it was replaced by the Constitution in 1789.</para>
