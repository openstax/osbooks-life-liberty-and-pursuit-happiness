<para id="fs-idm233210992"><emphasis effect="italics">Marbury v. Madison</emphasis>, 5 U.S. 137 (1803). This case involved the nomination of justices of the peace in Washington, DC, by President John Adams at the end of his term. Although the Senate confirmed the nominations, some of the commissions were not delivered before Adams left office. The new president, Thomas Jefferson, decided not to have his Secretary of State, James Madison, deliver the commissions. William Marbury, one of the offended justices, sued, saying that the Judiciary Act of 1789 empowered the court to force Secretary of State James Madison to deliver the commissions. In the unanimous decision, the court declared that while Marbury’s rights were violated because Madison refused to deliver the commission, the court did not have the power to force the secretary to do so because section 13 of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional. In declaring that part of the law conflicted with the U.S. Constitution, the case established the principle of judicial review wherein the Supreme Court could rule on the constitutionality of a law.</para>
<para id="fs-idm248312992"><emphasis effect="italics">McCulloch v. Maryland</emphasis>, 17 U.S. 316 (1819). The court considered the constitutionality of the national bank and whether states could tax the national government. After the Second Bank of the United States was chartered in 1816, the State of Maryland imposed a tax on it. James McCulloch, the head of the Baltimore branch of the national bank, refused to pay the tax. The State of Maryland argued that the Second Bank was unconstitutional as the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly grant Congress the power to establish a national bank. Maryland also argued that it should possess the power to tax the Second Bank. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress exercised a legal authority when it created the national bank since the Constitution in Article I, section 8 allows the legislature to pass laws that are “necessary and proper” to execute the related powers granted to the Congress. Additionally, the court ruled that the Supremacy Clause—which makes the Constitution the supreme law of the land over its powers—made the Maryland tax unconstitutional.</para>
<para id="fs-idm253103504"><emphasis effect="italics">Gibbons v. Ogden</emphasis>, 22 U.S. 1 (1824). The court considered the constitutionality of a license granted to Thomas Gibbons by the U.S. Congress to operate a steamship between New York and New Jersey. In the early 1800s, the State of New York granted monopolies to individuals to run steamboats within the state. Aaron Ogden was one of the men who received a monopoly. Ogden sued Gibbons, arguing that the Supreme Court should restrain Gibbons from impinging on his monopoly. The court ruled that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution in Article I, section 8 granted the federal government the power to regulate commerce between states. Therefore, any federal commerce licensing was determined to take precedence over any state commercial licensing. Gibbons was allowed to continue his work.</para>
<para id="fs-idm253618224"><emphasis effect="italics">Cherokee Nation v. Georgia</emphasis>, 30 U.S. 1 (1831). The State of Georgia passed laws depriving Cherokee of their rights within state boundaries in an attempt to force them out of coveted land. A group of Cherokee sued the state, arguing that the laws violated the Constitution. The Supreme Court ruled that Native Americans did not constitute a sovereign foreign nation because they were a “domestic, dependent nation” and therefore did not have the right to sue under the Constitution.</para>
<para id="fs-idm234159360"><emphasis effect="italics">Worcester v. Georgia</emphasis>, 31 U.S. 515 (1832). This case involved the question of whether state governments or the federal government had the power to regulate affairs of citizens with Native Americans. Samuel Worcester, an American missionary, was convicted of violating a Georgia law that prohibited white people from living on Native American land without a license. Worcester appealed his case to the Supreme Court, which determined that the national government possessed the sole authority to regulate affairs with Native Americans because the Indian nations were independent sovereign nations.</para>
<para id="fs-idm225324832"><emphasis effect="italics">Dred Scott v. Sandford</emphasis>, 60 U.S. 393 (1856). This case concerned the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise, which declared that certain states north of 36°30′ in the Louisiana Territory would be entirely free of slavery. Dred Scott, an enslaved person, was brought by his owner into free territories. When the owner brought him back to Missouri, a slave state, Dred Scott sued claiming that his time living in free territory made him free. After failing in his attempts in Missouri, Scott appealed to the Supreme Court. In a 7–2 decision, the court declared that the relevant parts of the Missouri Compromise were unconstitutional, that African Americans have never been and cannot be citizens of the United States, and that slaves were property protected by the Constitution. Scott remained a slave as a result.</para>
<para id="fs-idm226269728"><emphasis effect="italics">Ex Parte Merryman</emphasis>, 71 U.S. 2 (1866). This case concerned the constitutionality of the president’s powers during a time of war. At the outbreak of the Civil War, President Lincoln claimed broad emergency powers as commander-in-chief, including the suspension of the writ of <emphasis effect="italics">habeas corpus</emphasis>, which protects citizens from arrest and detention without trial in cases of rebellion or invasion. Lincoln used this power when he authorized the arrest of pro-secession Marylanders who had interfered with the transit of Union soldiers through Baltimore in 1861. The plaintiff, John Merryman, challenged Lincoln’s ability to arrest him without charge. The court ruled against Lincoln, saying that the authority to suspend <emphasis effect="italics">habeas corpus</emphasis> was reserved solely to Congress as it found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution. Lincoln ignored his ruling and submitted his actions to Congress for censure on July 4, 1861. He continued to suspend <emphasis effect="italics">habeas corpus</emphasis> in the border states throughout the duration of the Civil War, resulting in approximately 14,000 arrests.</para>
<para id="fs-idm258784912"><emphasis effect="italics">Plessy v. Ferguson</emphasis>, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). When Homer Plessy, a man of mixed racial heritage, sat in a whites-only railroad car in an attempt to challenge a Louisiana law that required railroad cars be segregated, he was arrested and convicted. Appealing his conviction to the Supreme Court, he argued that the segregation law was a violation of the principle of equal protection under the law in the Fourteenth Amendment. In a 7–1 decision, the court disagreed, indicating that the law was not a violation of the equal protection principle because the different train cars were separate but equal. <emphasis effect="italics">Plessy’s</emphasis> “separate but equal” remained a precedent until <emphasis effect="italics">Brown v. Board of Education</emphasis> (1954).</para>
<para id="fs-idm225476416"><emphasis effect="italics">Lochner v. New York</emphasis>, 198 U.S. 45 (1905). In 1895, the New York legislature passed a statute to protect workers. Known as the Bakeshop Act, it forbade bakers to work more than 60 hours a week or 10 hours a day. Joseph Lochner was twice accused of permitting an employee to work more than 60 hours in one week was fined both times. Lochner appealed his second conviction and was denied in state court. He appealed to the Supreme Court that the Bakeshop Act violated his “liberty of contract” to work as many hours as the individual wanted that was protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court ruled in his favor and invalidated the New York law, saying it violated an individual’s right to contract in an employer/employee relationship. Lochner was one of several decisions blocking attempted regulations of working conditions during the Progressive Era, though other cases allowed that state regulations were constitutional.</para>
<para id="fs-idm219811424"><emphasis effect="italics">Schenck v. U.S.</emphasis>, 249 U.S. 47 (1919). This case involved the constitutionality of the Espionage Act of 1917, passed after the United States entered World War I in order to prevent the impediment of the war effort, including military recruiting. Socialist Party member Charles Schenck distributed pamphlets encouraging men to resist the military draft, arguing that it violated citizens’ Thirteenth Amendment right to not be held in bondage. The U.S. government arrested and charged Schenck for violating the Espionage Act, arguing that his pamphlets obstructed the war effort. Schenck argued the Espionage Act violated his First Amendment right to free speech, and the case reached the Supreme Court. The court unanimously ruled that Schenck’s actions posed a “clear and present danger” during wartime and therefore his prosecution was not unconstitutional.</para>
<para id="fs-idm245136800"><emphasis effect="italics">A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</emphasis>, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). This case represented a challenge to the constitutionality of a law called the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). This law was a major part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s attempt to rebuild the nation’s economy during the Great Depression. The NIRA allowed industrial self-regulation and suspended anti-trust laws while empowering the National Recovery Administration to implement the law. In the unanimous decision, the court determined that the act was unconstitutional because it shifted the power to regulate commerce from the legislative branch to the executive branch and regulated intrastate commerce within a state contrary to the Commerce Clause in Article I, section 8.</para>
<para id="fs-idm243251232"><emphasis effect="italics">Korematsu v. U.S.</emphasis>, 323 U.S. 214 (1944). Two months after the World War II attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, requiring Japanese Americans to move from the West Coast as a matter of national security. Fred Korematsu, a Japanese American man living in the Bay area of California, refused to relocate and was eventually arrested, convicted, and sent to a relocation camp in Utah. He, in turn, argued that Executive Order 9066 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The court ruled against Korematsu, saying he had disobeyed orders that were justified by military necessity, and that Executive Order 9066 was issued pursuant to an act of Congress, and therefore a valid exercise of constitutional war powers per Article I, Section 8, Clause 11. Justice Robert Jackson dissented, arguing that Executive Order 9066 created a suspect racial category for a specific group of citizens that violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</para>
<para id="fs-idm219158384"><emphasis effect="italics">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</emphasis>, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). This case represented a challenge to the principle of “separate but equal” established by <emphasis effect="italics">Plessy v. Ferguson</emphasis> in 1896. The case was brought by students who were denied admittance to certain public schools based exclusively on race. The unanimous decision in <emphasis effect="italics">Brown v. Board</emphasis> determined that the existence of racially segregated public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court decided that schools segregated by race perpetrated harm by giving legal sanction to the idea that African Americans were inherently inferior. The ruling effectively overturned <emphasis effect="italics">Plessy v. Ferguson</emphasis> and removed the legal supports for segregated schools nationwide.</para>
<para id="fs-idm240613440"><emphasis effect="italics">Gideon v. Wainwright</emphasis>, 372 U.S. 335 (1963). In 1961, Clarence E. Gideon was arrested and accused of breaking into a pool room and stealing money from a cigarette machine. Not being able to afford a lawyer, and being denied a public defender by the judge, Gideon defended himself and was subsequently found guilty. Gideon appealed to the Supreme Court declaring that being denied the right to be represented by an attorney constituted a violation of his constitutional right to representation. The unanimous decision by the court in <emphasis effect="italics">Gideon v. Wainwright</emphasis> agreed that the Sixth Amendment required that those facing felony criminal charges be supplied with legal representation (which was later expanded to include non-felony criminal charges).</para>
<para id="fs-idm205597936"><emphasis effect="italics">Griswold v. Connecticut</emphasis>, 381 U.S. 479 (1965). This case involved the constitutionality of a Connecticut law outlawing the use of contraceptives. Estelle Griswold opened a birth control facility in Connecticut and was subsequently arrested for violating the law. Griswold argued that this constituted a violation of her right to due process and privileges and immunities as laid out in the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that while there is no explicit right to privacy listed in the Constitution, the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments had “zones of privacy” and “penumbras” and “emanations” from the explicit guarantees. Therefore, the Connecticut law was ruled to be a violation of the right to privacy and deemed unconstitutional.</para>
<para id="fs-idm243340928"><emphasis effect="italics">Miranda v. Arizona</emphasis>, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). When Ernesto Miranda was arrested, interrogated, and confessed to kidnapping in 1963, the arresting officers neglected to inform him of his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. After being found guilty at trial, Miranda appealed to the Supreme Court, insisting that the officers violated his Fifth Amendment rights. The 5–4 decision in <emphasis effect="italics">Miranda </emphasis>found that the right to not incriminate oneself relies heavily on the suspect’s right to be informed of these rights at the time of arrest. The opinion indicated that suspects must be told that they have the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent in order to ensure that any statements they provide are issued voluntarily.</para>
<para id="fs-idm233437120"><emphasis effect="italics">Tinker v. Des Moines</emphasis>, 393 U.S. 503 (1969). This case involved questions around what rights students possess concerning free speech while on school grounds. During the Vietnam War, the Des Moines school board created a policy to prevent students from wearing armbands to protest the war. John and Marybeth Tinker wore armbands to school and were disciplined for violating district policy. The case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that the school board’s policy violated the students’ First Amendment right to freedom of speech.</para>
<para id="fs-idm246160720"><emphasis effect="italics">Roe v. Wade</emphasis>, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). This case involved a pregnant woman from Texas who desired to terminate her pregnancy. At the time, Texas only allowed abortions in cases where the woman’s life was in danger. Using the pseudonym “Jane Roe,” the woman appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Constitution provides women the right to terminate an abortion. The 7–2 decision in <emphasis effect="italics">Roe v. Wade</emphasis> sided with the plaintiff and declared that the right to privacy upheld in the decision in <emphasis effect="italics">Griswold v. Connecticut</emphasis> (1965) included a woman’s right to an abortion. In balancing the rights of the woman with the interests of the states to protect human life, the court created a trimester framework. In the first trimester, a pregnant woman could seek an abortion without restriction. In the second trimester, however, the court asserted that states had an interest in regulating abortions. In the third trimester, the state could place severe restrictions on abortions except where the health of the mother was endangered.</para>
<para id="fs-idm210580112"><emphasis effect="italics">Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke</emphasis>, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). Allan Bakke, a white engineer and former Marine officer, was twice denied admission to the University of California, Davis, medical school. UC Davis had two admissions programs for the entering class of 100 students–a regular admissions program and a special admissions program. In both years, minority applicants were admitted with significantly lower scores than Bakke. Bakke challenged the regents of the university, arguing that the special admissions program operated to exclude him on the basis of his race in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In what was essentially a 5–4 ruling, the court found that affirmative action programs that take race into account can continue to play a role in the college admissions process, since creating a diverse classroom environment is a compelling state interest under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, quota systems such as the one used by UC Davis, were found to be in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. To date, the court has upheld the constitutionality of affirmative action programs in college admissions so long as other evaluative measures are taken into account for each individual in applications.</para>
<para id="fs-idm250332112"><emphasis effect="italics">Bush v. Gore</emphasis>, 531 U.S. 98 (2000). Following voting in the November 2000 presidential election, observers recognized that the outcome of the very close national election hinged on the outcome of the election in Florida. Because the Florida election was so close, manual recounts were called for by the state’s supreme court. Republican candidate George W. Bush, who was ahead in the initial count, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the manual recount and to declare that the method of manual recount being used violated his rights to equal protection and due process. The court issued a two-part <emphasis effect="italics">per curiam</emphasis> opinion on the case. (In a <emphasis effect="italics">per curiam</emphasis> opinion, the court makes it clear that the decision in the case is not intended to set a legal precedent.) In the first part, the court ruled in a 7–2 decision that the manual recount violated the plaintiff’s right to equal protection. In the second part, the court decided by a smaller 5–4 margin that there was not sufficient time to adjust the recount procedure and conduct a full recount. The effect of this ruling gave the Florida electoral votes, and thus the presidency, to George W. Bush.</para>
