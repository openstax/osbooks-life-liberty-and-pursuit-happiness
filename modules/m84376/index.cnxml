<para id="fs-idm222188128">The gasoline-powered, internal-combustion automobile revolutionized human life: It brought people together. It made trade and commerce far easier. It connected cities to growing suburbs. It helped rural Americans travel to towns. It gave young people more independence. It helped stimulate the development of the factory <term>assembly line</term>. It revolutionized the American economy and society.</para>
<para id="fs-idm190692384">And Henry Ford revolutionized the automobile. Companies had made cars before Henry Ford; 502 auto companies were founded between 1900 and 1908. But early automobiles were expensive, difficult to drive, and hard to maintain, and the roads on which they were driven were primitive. Owning a car was barely better than owning a horse. Michigan‚Äôs Ford, a born tinkerer, had a better idea. Actually, he had a vision. ‚ÄúI will build a motor car for the great multitude,‚Äù he proclaimed. ‚ÄúIt will be large enough for the family but small enough for the individual to run and care for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise. But it will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one‚Äîand enjoy with his family the blessing of hours of pleasure in God‚Äôs great open spaces.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm218793408">That is easy to say. But how would Ford‚Äîoften derided as ‚ÄúCrazy Henry‚Äù Ford‚Äîaccomplish his goal after failing at several early attempts at car making (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_HenryFord"/>)?</para>

<caption>Henry Ford, pictured here in 1919, revolutionized the automobile industry by making cars available to more middle-class American consumers than ever before.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm496729840">He did it by embracing mass production and standardizing the parts in each car. Those ideas were not exactly new even then. Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin, had introduced standardized parts in firearms manufacturing back in the early 1800s. But Henry Ford built massive factories with assembly lines to manufacture cars for the entire American population. He also standardized the tasks needed to assemble cars. ‚ÄúThe man who places a part does not fasten it,‚Äù he explained ‚ÄúThe man who puts in a bolt does not put on the nut; the man who puts on the nut does not tighten it.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm203687200">Ford‚Äôs ideas succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. The Ford Motor Company‚Äôs manufacturing methods allowed it to cut the price of automobiles dramatically, and because more Americans could now afford a car, sales skyrocketed and Ford soon dominated the industry.</para>
<para id="fs-idm467540384">When Ford Motor started operations, it required 13 man-hours to assembly a vehicle. Henry Ford drove that down to a mere 93 minutes. As a competitor noted:</para>
<quote id="fs-idm222949600">From 1909-10 to 1916-17 the price of Ford‚Äôs Model T was lowered year by year as follows: $950, $780, $690, $600, $490, $440, $360. The magical result of that was a volume that justified the cost of the factory changes that preceded each cut in price. In those same years his production schedule grew as follows: 18,664; 34,528; 168,220; 248,307; 308,213; 533,921; 785,432.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm463442080">Ford introduced his most successful car, the famous ‚ÄúModel T,‚Äù in September 1908. By the time the last Model T rolled off the assembly line in May 1927, a phenomenal 15 million of them had been sold. In 1918, a farmer‚Äôs wife near Rome, Georgia, wrote to Ford: ‚ÄúYou know, Henry, your car lifted us out of the mud, it brought joy into our lives. We loved every rattle in its bones. . . .‚Äù (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_ModelT"/>).</para>
<figure id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_ModelT" class="scaled-down-60">
<media id="fs-idm180382592" alt="Henry Ford stands in front of a Model T.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/BRI_APUSH_11_03_ModelT.jpg"/>
</media>
<caption>The Model T, pictured here in 1921 with Henry Ford, was the most successful of Ford Motor Company‚Äôs models.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm228792032">Efficiency had its cost in human terms, however. Ford‚Äôs repetitive assembly-line system ground his workers down, and high turnover became a problem. To solve it, in 1914, Ford doubled his workers‚Äô pay rate to an unheard-of $5 per day, causing workers to flock to his factories. The high wages also startled the world and at the same time made it possible for Ford‚Äôs employees to purchase their own Model Ts.</para>
<para id="fs-idm497959856">But the same free market that contributed to Ford‚Äôs success allowed other industrialists to challenge his prominence. Ford had dominated his competitors, but he never eliminated them. His most important competitor was the highly innovative General Motors.</para>
<para id="fs-idm512296160">From the beginning, General Motors (GM) was very different from Ford‚Äôs operation. GM‚Äôs cofounder William Durant had already achieved great success early in life by manufacturing horse-drawn vehicles. And whereas Ford Motor Company long remained focused on a single product line, GM introduced a wide array of subsidiary companies and models: Oldsmobiles, Cadillacs, Buicks, Plymouths, and, most prominently, Chevrolets, GM‚Äôs most affordable model. Nonetheless, in 1921, GM controlled less than 13 percent of the U.S. auto market (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_Chevy1921"/>).</para>
<figure id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_Chevy1921" class="scaled-down-60">
<media id="fs-idm214299216" alt="The photograph of the automobile is labeled ‚Äú1921 Chevrolet.‚Äù">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/BRI_APUSH_11_03_Chevy1921.jpg"/>
</media>
<caption>The 1921 Chevrolet 490, named for its price of $490, was able to compete with the Ford Model T by being $5 cheaper and coming with an electric horn, a speedometer, and headlight dimmers.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm180431984">Durant was twice forced out of his company. Eventually, control passed to Alfred P. Sloan Jr., who had gained success and wealth by supplying roller bearings to the auto industry. Sloan was ready to make changes to car manufacturing and sales that Ford would not. Ford forced other shareholders out of his company and decided he knew what was best for consumers, famously saying that ‚ÄúAny customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.‚Äù (He had discovered that black paint dried the most quickly on his assembly lines.) To Henry Ford, time was money, and money saved could be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices.</para>
<para id="fs-idm207279424">But not everyone wanted a car that was black. Not everyone wanted a Ford or a Model T. Not everyone wanted to take orders from one man at the top of the corporate pyramid. Alfred P. Sloan let each division of General Motors operate in its own way. He was not only an innovator in corporate organization, he also mastered the new consumer culture of the 1920s. If consumers started out owning a Chevrolet but wanted a better car when their incomes rose, he would be happy to sell them a Buick or an Oldsmobile. If they were doing really well, he would be more than glad to sell them an expensive Cadillac. And if consumers did not have the cash to buy a GM product, the company would sell them one on credit.</para>
<para id="fs-idm495370016">Sloan also pioneered what became known as ‚Äúplanned obsolescence‚Äù by creating a different model of each GM brand each year. There might be technological improvements or maybe just a styling upgrade. But the changes in each new ‚Äúmodel year‚Äù were designed to create interest in GM and sell more GM vehicles to consumers who were merely tired of their old cars. Said Sloan, GM existed ‚Äúnot . . . to make motor cars‚Äù but ‚Äúto make money‚Äù (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_TimeASloan"/>).</para>
<figure id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_TimeASloan" class="scaled-down-30">

</media>
<caption>Alfred P. Sloan, pictured here on the cover of <emphasis effect="italics">Time</emphasis> magazine in 1926, made consumers feel they had choices by changing GM‚Äôs models each year and offering multiple colors.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm185410096">As Sloan explained,</para>
<quote id="fs-idm497483984">[T]he corporation should produce a line of cars in each price area, from the lowest price up to one for a strictly high-grade quantity production car. . . . [T]he price steps should not be such as to leave wide gaps in the line, and yet should be great enough to keep their number within reason, so that the greatest advantage of quantity production could be secured; and . . . There should be no duplication by the corporation in the priceline of steps.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm495298160">In the 1920s, GM charged forward while Ford stood still. Henry Ford refused to innovate or respond to consumer demand, and by the mid-1920s, many people were buying GM cars instead of Fords. Ford‚Äôs company was falling behind the times‚Äîand fast. Not a particularly young man when he entered the auto business, Ford was now in his sixties, but he reacted boldly. He closed his plants for most of 1927‚Äînot one car rolled off his once-dominant assembly lines‚Äîwhile he figured out what to do next. The result was the new-fangled Model A, and the public loved it. Ten million people‚Äî8.5 percent of the U.S. population‚Äîsaw the car within the first 36 hours of its release. At New York‚Äôs Madison Square Garden, 1,250,000 people trooped in to see it in just five days.</para>
<para id="fs-idm192429824">The Model A went 65 miles per hour, came in four colors, and boasted 17 body styles. And, like GM‚Äôs product line, it could be bought on credit. Within six months, Ford had sold an astounding two million Model As. He had emulated GM‚Äôs methods and was competitive once again.</para>
<para id="fs-idm223574464">Eventually, both Ford and Sloan had reacted to the demands of the marketplace. Consumers now enjoyed a wider variety of cars offered by large manufacturers. In the 1920s, automobiles became one of the staples of the American economy and consumer culture. Over the next few decades, they also facilitated the rise of suburbs, increased geographical mobility, and stimulated the travel and tourism industry around the country.</para>
