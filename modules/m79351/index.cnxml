<para id="fs-idm205230400">The Nullification Crisis of 1832‚Äì1833 began with the passage of the Tariff of 1828‚Äîbetter known as the <term>Tariff of Abominations</term>‚Äîwhich sought to protect industrial products from competition with foreign imports. Tariffs are taxes levied on imports and are designed to artificially increase the prices of foreign goods to give a competitive advantage to domestic industries that make the same goods. The Tariff of 1828 was passed in response to the lobbying of northern manufacturers, who argued that they needed protection from British competition to expand infant U.S. industries. These manufacturers and their political allies argued that without a protective tariff, and an independent industry, the United States would always remain in a colonial relationship with Europe. To them, competition was about much more than boosting the profits of northern entrepreneurs; it was a necessary measure to secure the independence and prosperity of the nation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm179448368">Protective tariffs were not a new invention. The first one was passed in 1789 and placed a 5 percent tax on most imported goods. Congress‚Äôs power to pass tariffs is based on Article I, Section 8, Clauses 1 and 3 of the U.S. Constitution, which provide the following: ‚ÄúThe Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm179367408">Although protective tariffs were not new, the high tariff rates were. The rate under the Tariff of 1828 was nearly 49 percent. This was a boon for northern manufacturers but a burden for consumers as well as southern plantation owners, who were largely uninvolved with the domestic manufacturing industry. Southern planters were dependent on European trade and concerned about the negative impact of a high tariff on their ability to buy and sell goods. This concern was compounded by the drop in cotton prices throughout the 1820s as a result of the financial panic of 1819. Still reeling from the agricultural depression, Southerners feared the tariff would make the situation worse by raising the cost of manufactured goods purchased by farmers and planters and provoking retaliatory European tariffs that would lower foreign demand for their agricultural exports to other nations.</para>
<para id="fs-idm202295072">Despite fierce political opposition to the tariff bill, President John Quincy Adams signed it into law. In doing so, he paved the way for Andrew Jackson to win the 1828 presidential election. Vice President John C. Calhoun (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_06_03_Calhoun"/>) of South Carolina published the <emphasis effect="italics">South Carolina Exposition and Protest</emphasis>, responding to the 1828 tariff and setting forth arguments in favor of state nullification of federal laws. Calhoun asserted states had the right to decide on the constitutionality of protective tariffs and to reject federal laws within their borders. He viewed the United States as a partnership of sovereign states, in which the federal government acted as an agent to achieve ends narrowly defined in the Constitution. For Calhoun, therefore, sovereignty originated in the states, and because of this, the states retained the right to act in their own best interests, even if that meant superseding federal law.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm177564128">Calhoun‚Äôs vision of the United States was more closely aligned with the concept of state sovereignty set out in the Articles of Confederation than with the U.S. Constitution, but his argument for nullification was not entirely unprecedented. In response to the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson had drafted the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, which declared these laws unconstitutional and called on other states to do the same. At that time, the case of <emphasis effect="italics">Marbury v. Madison</emphasis> (1803), in which the Supreme Court claimed the power of judicial review to strike down unconstitutional laws, was still in the future. Jefferson and Madison accepted the premise that the federal Constitution was a compact among the states and that states, as parties to that compact, have a right and duty to interpret and enforce its terms. So when an act is unconstitutional, as Madison, Jefferson, and their allies believed the Alien and Sedition Acts were, the states could use their power to protect citizens from the federal government. But while Jefferson and Madison believed states should act together to protect their residents from unconstitutional laws, Calhoun believed individual states could act alone.</para>
<para id="fs-idm202219712">Calhoun‚Äôs ideas about nullification became better known when his fellow South Carolinian, Senator Robert Hayne, defended Calhoun‚Äôs ideology in a series of celebrated debates with Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_06_03_DanWebster"/>). On one side were Hayne and Calhoun. On the other was Webster, who pointed to the Constitution‚Äôs Supremacy clause in Article VI of the Constitution: ‚ÄúThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof . . . shall be the Supreme Law of the Land.‚Äù Webster believed the federal courts, not the states, were the appropriate venue for deciding disputes over the constitutional validity of legislation. For him, the country would be returned to the problematic system of government it experienced under the Articles of Confederation if the doctrine of state nullification were accepted.</para>

<para id="fs-idm205796960">Andrew Jackson, a slaveowner with southern loyalties and a proponent of states‚Äô rights, inherited the struggle over the Tariff of 1828 when he was elected president. He had strong feelings about state nullification, which he expressed in an official proclamation against nullification: ‚ÄúDisunion by armed force is <emphasis effect="italics">treason</emphasis>.‚Äù The president had a constitutional duty to execute federal law and was not going to allow the states to impede it.</para>
<para id="fs-idm180785328">In response to the looming political battle and in an effort to appease Southerners, Congress passed the Tariff of 1832, lowering the 1828 rates but maintaining a rate that was still highly protectionist. The newly elected South Carolina legislature responded by calling for a state nullification convention. On November 24, 1832, the convention met and passed the Ordinance of Nullification, which stated the protective tariffs were ‚Äúunauthorized by the Constitution of the United States . . . and are null and void.‚Äù The convention ordered all state officials to declare that they would ‚Äúobey, execute, and enforce‚Äù the Nullification Ordinance or face removal from office. South Carolina courts were to ignore Supreme Court decisions on the constitutionality of tariffs and the following warning was delivered to President Jackson:</para>
<quote id="fs-idm210906128">We, the People of South Carolina . . . are determined to maintain this, our Ordinance and Declaration, at every hazard, do further Declare, that we will not submit to the application of Force, on the part of the Federal Government, to reduce this State to obedience; but that we will consider the passage, by Congress, of any act . . . to coerce the State . . . as inconsistent with the longer continuance of South Carolina in the Union.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm220142448">South Carolina, therefore, was threatening not only to openly defy the federal government but also to put up armed resistance and possibly secede. President Jackson responded with his own proclamation regarding nullification, in which he stated:</para>
<quote id="fs-idm203933664">The Constitution of the United States . . . forms a government, not a league. . . . The power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, [is] incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every great principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm294411120">On December 17, 1832, one week after issuing his proclamation, Jackson told Secretary of War Lewis Cass, ‚ÄúWe must be prepared to act with promptness and crush the monster in its cradle before it matures to manhood. We must be prepared for the crisis.‚Äù At the same time, the new South Carolina governor, Robert Hayne, whose former Senate seat was now occupied by John C. Calhoun and who had resigned as Jackson‚Äôs vice president (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_06_03_Hayne"/>), was mobilizing men and arms to defend the state‚Äôs sovereignty.</para>
<figure id="BRI_APUSH_06_03_Hayne" class="scaled-down-30">

<caption>With John C. Calhoun, Robert Hayne (shown in this undated image) was one of the leading proponents of a doctrine of states‚Äô rights that was later used by the South to justify secession.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm285995104">South Carolina‚Äôs ordinance was to take effect on February 1, 1833. With that deadline on the horizon, Jackson urged Congress to pass the Force Bill, giving him the authority to enforce the federal tariff via the military. While he was ramping up the conflict with the Force Bill proposal on the one hand, Jackson was attempting to defuse the situation on the other by advocating rapid tariff reduction. Congress also recognized the political wisdom of lowering tariff levels. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky introduced a series of bills that sought to avert violence over the crisis. He engineered the Compromise Tariff of 1833; it stipulated that protectionism would be ended by 1842 via reduction on import taxes. The Compromise Tariff of 1833 was balanced by the passage of the Force Bill, which gave the president congressional approval for using military force to enforce federal laws. The Force Act was the sword to the Compromise Tariff‚Äôs olive branch, as Henry Clay stated. Although the compromise ultimately gave South Carolina some of what it wanted with a reduced tariff, it also reinforced that the federal government would not tolerate state nullification.</para>
<para id="fs-idm204616352">The Nullification Crisis had serious long-term repercussions and ultimately laid the ideological and political groundwork for the secession of southern states thirty years later. Sectional differences and the inability to find a long-term compromise over the issue of slavery and its expansion then erupted into open warfare and tore the Union apart.</para>
