<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm194057712">On April 6, 1917, Congress officially declared war against Germany for “repeated acts of war against the people of the United States of America.” However, some AmericansAespecially socialists, anarchists, and those with strong connections to GermanyGopposed the conflict. Antiwar groups encouraged workers not to support the war effort and encouraged men to resist the draft. President Woodrow Wilson and the U.S. Congress feared these efforts threatened the full mobilization of resources and manpower for fighting the war; therefore, they passed the Espionage Act in June 1917.</para>

<para id="fs-idm202824752">Charles Schenck was a socialist who published materials encouraging draftees to petition against the draft. The U.S. government prosecuted him under the Espionage Act, arguing that this violated the text of Section 3, which prohibited the encouragement of mutiny and disorder in the military. Schenck argued that the law represented a violation of his First Amendment rights. Do you agree with him? Explain.</para>
