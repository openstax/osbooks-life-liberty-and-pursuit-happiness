<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm241915232">On February 21, 1797, Secretary of State Timothy Pickering informed Congress that France had seized more than three hundred U.S. merchant ships in the past eleven months. France and Great Britain were at war, but the United States remained neutral. Affronted by this attack on U.S. neutrality, President John Adams asked Congress for preparations for war, leading to an undeclared “quasi-war.” In 1798, the Federalists in Congress passed and Adams signed the Alien and Sedition Acts. The Alien Act increased the amount of time it took to become a naturalized citizen and authorized the president to deport from the United States aliens deemed a threat to national security. The Sedition Act made it a crime to criticize the U.S. government, the president, or the Congress. The government eventually prosecuted about a dozen Jeffersonian-Republican newspaper editors under the Sedition Act. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts by writing resolutions adopted by the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures asserting the laws were unconstitutional.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">That the General Assembly doth also express its deep regret, that a spirit has in sundry instances, been manifested by the federal government, to enlarge its powers by forced <emphasis effect="bold">constructions</emphasis> of the constitutional charter which defines them; and that implications have appeared of a design to expound certain general phrases (which having been copied from the very limited grant of power, in the former articles of confederation were the less liable to be misconstrued) so as to destroy the meaning and effect, of the particular <emphasis effect="bold">enumeration</emphasis> which necessarily explains and limits the general phrases; <link target-id="fs-idm265389984">and so as to consolidate the states by degrees, into one sovereignty, the obvious tendency and inevitable consequence of which would be, to transform the present republican system of the United States, into an absolute, or at best a mixed monarchy.</link></entry>

And it doubts not that their sense will be so announced as to prove their attachment unaltered to limited Government, whether general or particular, and that the rights and liberties of their Co-states will be exposed to no dangers by remaining embarked on a common bottom with their own: That they will concur with this Commonwealth in considering the said acts as so palpably against the Constitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration, that the Compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the General Government, but that it will proceed in the exercise over these states of all powers whatsoever: That they will view this as <link target-id="fs-idm265948128">seizing the rights of the states and <emphasis effect="bold">consolidating</emphasis> them in the hands of the General Government with a power assumed to bind the states (not merely in cases made federal) but in all cases whatsoever, by laws made, not with their consent, but by others against their consent: That this would be to surrender the form of Government we have chosen, and to live under one deriving its powers from its own will, and not from our authority;</link> and <link target-id="fs-idm228135792">that the Co-states recurring to their natural right in cases not made federal, will concur in declaring these acts void and of no force, and will each unite with this Commonwealth in requesting their repeal at the next session of Congress.</link></entry>
