<para id="fs-idm486309824">Large monuments mark the resting place of many presidents. But not the grave of Calvin Coolidge. The gravestone of the thirtieth president stands in a modest row, no higher than many others. The only way visitors to the little graveyard in the village of Plymouth Notch, Vermont, can tell Calvin Coolidge’s from the rest is by the faint presidential seal engraved on it.</para>
<para id="fs-idm175474880">Coolidge, who served from 1923 to 1929, wanted it that way. As modest as his wishes for his headstone, he spoke so rarely in meetings that he earned the nickname “Silent Cal.” In policymaking, he exercised restraint where other presidents jumped in. Some historians have interpreted this as weakness, yet moderation was also his strength (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_Coolidge"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm486358288">Life in Plymouth Notch, where Coolidge was born in 1872, was not easy. The soil was too rocky for great success in farming, the winters too cold for comfort. The president’s grandfather, Calvin Galusha Coolidge, struggled to find the right crop, at one point even importing merino sheep. The town exported milk, but without electricity, a train station, or autos, the milk spoiled before reaching market. Coolidge’s creative father started a cooperative cheese factory. Cheese did not need refrigeration.</para>
<para id="fs-idm726308992">Coolidge’s first lessons about politics came during town meetings, where he watched his father oversee property disputes, discuss the maintenance of the Plymouth Union Church, and vote against high taxes because not everyone could pay. Common sense, civility, service, and respect for the individual were basic values in Plymouth. So was government service. Both Coolidge’s father and his grandfather served in the state legislature in Montpelier. Life was humble. Even as a boy, Coolidge knew that Abraham Lincoln, born in a one-room cabin, had risen to president. “American citizenship is a high estate,” as Coolidge wrote later about republican equality. “He who holds it is the peer of kings.”</para>
<para id="fs-idm472887008">Coolidge’s personal start was also tough. His mother died when he was young, and he struggled at school. When the shy young man went down the Connecticut Valley to attend Amherst College, he became so homesick he nearly gave up. Though Coolidge wanted to join a fraternity, at first none would have him. Eventually, however, he found his footing as a debater, winning the respect of surprised classmates, who wrote in his senior year that they had discovered “a new and gifted man.” Coolidge’s debate friends attended Columbia Law School, but he did not have the money to follow them. Instead, he took a job as clerk to a law firm in Northampton, Massachusetts (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_CoolidgeAm"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm447424192">Yet again, Coolidge persevered. Studying law by himself at night, he managed to pass the bar exam earlier than his family or firm expected. Still awkward, he surprised acquaintances again by winning the heart of one of the prettiest young women in Northampton, Grace Anna Goodhue, a teacher of the deaf. Soon the Coolidges had two sons, John and Calvin. Gradually, the young lawyer got a start in politics, serving on Republican-Party committees, then in city government, then as a state representative in Boston, and finally as governor of Massachusetts.</para>
<para id="fs-idm486185120">In Coolidge’s time as a Massachusetts politician, between 1900 and 1920, the Progressive movement reached its apex. In his own party, the Republican Party, President Theodore Roosevelt personified an active presidency. “Get action,” Roosevelt once said. The Democratic president Woodrow Wilson also signed many progressive laws, including one creating the federal income tax. Coolidge differed from both these presidents in preferring caution. “It is better to kill a bad law than pass a good one,” he once wrote his father. Speaking to his fellow state senators in 1913, Coolidge admonished, “Give administration a chance to catch up with legislation.” He also thought most governing should be done by states, counties, and towns, not by the federal government.</para>
<para id="fs-idm465068352">Coolidge was popular, in part because he was always civil and opposed negative campaigning. He understood that to attack an opponent was to advertise that opponent. Voters also liked him because of his hard work and devotion to service. As a lawyer, Coolidge often represented immigrants in court, sometimes for free, and an impressive share of Irish and German immigrants, new citizens of Massachusetts, backed him when he ran for office. No matter how individuals got to America, he would later say, “we are all now in the same boat here.”</para>
<para id="fs-idm725171424">The signal event of Coolidge’s Massachusetts career came in September 1919 when he was governor. It was just after World War I, and in many cities, underpaid workers were going out on strike. The contracts of the Boston police did not permit them to do so, yet the members of the force walked off the job. Riots and looting ensued. The police commissioner fired the police, and as governor, Coolidge called in the National Guard. The police then sought a reconciliation, but Coolidge issued a firm no, saying, “There is no right to strike against the public safety, by anybody, anywhere, any time.” Coolidge wrote to his father that the controversial move could cost him the election, scheduled for that November. Instead it propelled him to national prominence. In 1920, Coolidge joined Warren Harding as vice president on a victorious Republican ticket that called for more cautious government, law and order, and “normalcy” (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_HrdingCool"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm447211264">The great challenge for the White House in the 1920s was to curtail the massive debt that was the legacy of World War I. If America could not cut back this debt, it would lose its new preeminence in the world. The obvious solution was to raise taxes. Yet tax rates were already so high that businesses and individuals wasted valuable energy finding ways not to pay. Revenues did not come in as predicted. Around the same time that President Harding suddenly passed away in August 1923, the presidency became mired in the scandal known as <term>Teapot Dome</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm191676960">Coolidge took up two tasks: cleansing the besmirched presidency and setting the government’s fiscal house in order. He hired special prosecutors from both parties to sort out the Teapot Dome scandal and set out not merely to reduce budget increases but to reduce spending altogether. He used an image from his own hometown of Plymouth Notch to describe budget cuts as “cheese paring.” The president’s fiscal determination even showed up in the names he gave twin lion cubs presented to the White House. They were dubbed “Budget Bureau” and “Tax Reduction.”</para>
<para id="fs-idm172543872">Coolidge also worked on the tax problem. He and his Treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon, believed firms that got to keep more of their money would conduct more business, hire more workers, and invest more money back into their operations. Then the government might collect greater tax revenue than expected due to the increased economic activity. So the administration and Congress lowered top tax rates all the way down to 25 percent. The strategy worked, along with the burgeoning expansion of prosperity. Enough cash flowed in to keep the federal budget balanced and to cut the debt by one-third. When Coolidge left office, the budget was actually smaller than when he had come in 67 months before.</para>
<para id="fs-idm477194224">History books and fiction sometimes treat the 1920s as an economic bubble. But the bulk of the growth in the 1920s, especially during Coolidge’s tenure, was very real, with a record patent rate and great increases in productivity. Instead of working six days, employees could earn enough by working only five. In the 1920s, both parties overwhelmingly backed immigration restriction. Coolidge signed the restrictive Johnson-Reed Act, also known as the as the Immigration Act of 1924.</para>
<para id="fs-idm188000336">In 1924 Coolidge’s son Calvin, Jr. was 16 and growing so fast his shoes became tight. When a blister he got while playing tennis on the White House court became infected, the infection spread throughout his body. There were no antibiotics in those days and, after a week, Calvin Jr. died. Like Lincoln, another president who lost a young son while in office, Coolidge persevered, winning his first campaign for president the same year with a majority larger than those of his opponents combined. Coolidge received 382 electoral votes to Democrat John W. Davis’s 136 and Progressive Party candidate Robert M. LaFollette’s 13.</para>
<para id="fs-idm217001024">Perhaps Coolidge’s greatest achievement was something he did not do. In 1928, the Republicans expected him to run for president a second time. After all, he had been elected only once before, in 1924. Coolidge noted, however, that the longer a president stayed in office, the more he seemed like royalty. An imperial presidency threw the three-branch system of government out of balance. “The chances of having wise and faithful service are increased by a change in the presidential office from time to time,” he concluded, and so he declined to run.</para>
<para id="fs-idm727301056">Coolidge is sometimes blamed for the Great Depression of the 1930s. But although the stock market of the late 1920s was due for a drop, he was not responsible for its increase nor for the factors that made the Depression endure a decade; they were policies that mostly came into effect after his presidency. Coolidge’s moderation provides a model for America’s highest office that can be useful to all politicians today.</para>
