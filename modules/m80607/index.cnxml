<para id="fs-idm486150960">In the mid-nineteenth century, Americans continued to move westward, driven to settle the continent by the providential ideal of Manifest Destiny. They traveled along various overland trails and railroads to Oregon, California, Colorado, and the Dakota Territory in search of agricultural land and gold. American Indians who lived and hunted in the West were alarmed at encroachment by white people on their lands, which were usually protected by treaties. The conflict led to several violent clashes throughout the West in the 1850s and 1860s, in which combatants and noncombatants on both sides became casualties of war.</para>
<para id="fs-idm344588800">The Black Hills (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_09_03_InyanKara"/>), located in modern-day South Dakota, was a contested area among several American Indian tribes and one of the centers of fighting between them and settlers. The Lakota Sioux and their Cheyenne allies had displaced the Crow, Arikara, Kiowa, Pawnee, and Shoshone tribes westward from the area. The Sioux and Cheyenne had acquired horses and firearms from Europeans and Americans starting in the mid-eighteenth century and incorporated them into warrior cultures that valued personal courage in battle. They also used horses and guns to hunt buffalo for sustenance and to dominate the fur trade in the area.</para>

<para id="fs-idm441923968">The 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty guaranteed lands in parts of Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, and the Dakotas to various American Indian tribes. The terms of the treaty provided safe passage for American emigrants through the territory and allowed the government to build roads there. The Indians were to be protected from white settlers and given annual provisions. Some Sioux tribal leaders signed the treaty, but the Oglala Sioux leader, Black Hawk, refused and denounced it. ‚ÄúThese lands once belonged to the Kiowas and the Crows, but we whipped those nations out of them, and in this we did what the white men do when they want the lands of the Indians.‚Äù His words proved to be prophetic.</para>
<para id="fs-idm479626688">Continued fighting led the two sides to sign the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty, which created the Great Sioux Reservation on a large part of the territory contained in the earlier treaty. The new agreement guaranteed the Sioux hunting rights and the removal of U.S. military forts from the area. However, the Americans saw it as part of the process of establishing reservations for Indian tribes and eventually assimilating them into American culture with schools, agriculture, and private plots of land. The Sioux appreciated the protections in the treaty but did not feel bound to adopt white ways or be constrained in pursuing their traditional way of life.</para>
<para id="fs-idm475264288">Meanwhile, tensions were high in other parts of the West. In Kansas, the Cheyenne had killed more than 100 settlers in 1867, and Lieutenant Colonel George Custer was dispatched to the Oklahoma Territory to carry out retribution against the Cheyenne. Custer was the flamboyant but brave hero of Gettysburg and other Civil War campaigns who, after the war, had alternatively fought Indians in the West and performed Reconstruction occupation duty in the South. In late November 1868, he led the Seventh Cavalry through deep snow to attack a large Cheyenne village of 6,000 people on the Washita River, in southwestern Oklahoma.</para>
<para id="fs-idm299617520">Custer divided his army into four columns and deployed them to assault the village and block any escape. Fearing his army was in danger of being overwhelmed, he used 53 women and children as hostages as he withdrew his troops. After Major Joel Elliott and his 18 men were killed in a last stand, an officer blamed Custer in a letter to a friend; a newspaper obtained the letter and published it anonymously. When Custer threatened to horsewhip the letter‚Äôs author, Captain Frederick Benteen boldly admitted he wrote it and Custer backed down, appearing weak. The dissension in the regiment‚Äôs command boded ill for the future, however.</para>
<para id="fs-idm328249488">Tensions with American Indians continued to simmer in the early 1870s. The Transcontinental Railroad contributed to western development and the integration of national markets, but it also intruded on American Indian lands. Two military expeditions were dispatched to Montana to protect the railroad and its workers in 1872. The Panic of 1873 bankrupted the Northern Pacific Railroad and temporarily halted railroad building, but the tide of settlers could not be stemmed. In 1874, gold was reportedly discovered in the Black Hills within the heart of the Great Sioux Reservation. By the end of 1875, as many as 15,000 prospectors and miners had flooded the Black Hills in search of gold (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_09_03_BlackHills"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm326591888">Many of the Sioux and Cheyenne were irate at the presence of so many Americans in violation of the Fort Laramie treaties. Sitting Bull was an elite Lakota Sioux war leader in his mid-40s and a respected holy man who had visions and dreams. Another important leader was the Oglala Lakota supreme war chief Crazy Horse, a leader called a ‚Äúshirt-wearer‚Äù‚Äú with a reputation as a fierce warrior. Both resisted the reservations and American encroachment on their lands. They wanted Indian autonomy and were willing to unite and fight for it.</para>
<para id="fs-idm333790816">In early November 1875, President Ulysses S. Grant met with General Philip Sheridan and other advisors on Indian policy at the White House. They issued an ultimatum for all Sioux outside the reservation to go there by January 31, 1876, or be considered hostile. The Sioux ignored ‚Äôthe edict from Washington, DC. Sitting Bull said, ‚ÄúI will not go to the reservation. I have no land to sell. There is plenty of game for us. We have enough ammunition. We don‚Äôt want any white men here.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm475594512">In March, General George Crook attacked the Cheyenne on the Powder River, prompting them to go to the nearby Oglala camp and then the massive Sioux village. The different Indian tribes decided to unite through the summer and fight the encroaching Americans. In the spring, Sitting Bull called for warriors at the agencies to assemble at his village for war. The U.S. federal government established agencies that provided land, rations, and protection for the American Indians. Nearly 2,000 warriors answered the call and swelled the village of 8,000 American Indians by June. Many were armed with the latest repeating Springfield rifles.</para>
<para id="fs-idm303174384">That spring, Sitting Bull reported visions and dreams with omens that promised victory over the white man. In mid-May, he fasted and purified himself in a ritual called the Sun Dance. After 50 small strips of flesh had been cut from each arm, he had a vision that showed the whites coming into the Indians‚Äô camp and suffering a great defeat. Meanwhile, Custer and the Seventh Cavalry regiment were also planning a summer campaign.</para>
<para id="fs-idm332019600">In mid-May, 1,000 U.S. soldiers formed up in a column and set out from Fort Abraham Lincoln. The Seventh Cavalry combined 140 men of the Sixth Infantry and 40 Indian scouts, mostly Arikara. An even larger force of 1,300 cavalry and Indian allies left Fort Fetterman under General George Crook and were searching for Sitting Bull‚Äôs village on the Rosebud River. Although Sitting Bull had ordered the warriors to adopt a defensive posture, the young warriors rushed out to attack the column and assaulted it several times. Crook was surprised at the tenacity and unprecedented discipline of the enemy assaults and had to return to the fort because of his casualties and low supplies of ammunition. He failed to send word to General Alfred Terry or Custer.</para>
<para id="fs-idm304313600">After discovering the approximate location of Sitting Bull‚Äôs village, Terry met with Custer and Colonel John Gibbon on the Yellowstone River to formulate a plan. They agreed on a classic hammer-and- anvil attack in which Custer would proceed down the Rosebud River and attack the village while Terry and Gibbon went down the Yellowstone and Little Bighorn Rivers by June 26 to block any escape (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_09_03_YellowBig"/>). Terry said he had ‚Äútoo much confidence in your zeal, energy, and ability to wish to impose upon your precise orders, which might hamper your action when nearly in contact with the enemy,‚Äù giving Custer wide latitude to proceed alone in his hunt for glory. Custer refused four additional companies of cavalry and two Gatling guns.</para>

<para id="fs-idm451792128">On June 23 and 24, Custer‚Äôs Arikara scouts found increasing evidence that Sitting Bull‚Äôs village had recently occupied the area. After a long day in the saddle, the exhausted men stopped for the night at 2 a.m. on June 25. The scouts, meanwhile, went to a high vantage point they named the Crow‚Äôs Nest to spy for any sign of the village. After sighting a massive herd of ponies, they sent a message to wake Custer. When a frightened scout, Bloody Knife, warned they would ‚Äúfind enough Sioux to keep us fighting two or three days,‚Äù Custer replied, ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôll get through them in one day.‚Äù The scouts were certain the regiment had been seen, and Custer‚Äôs greatest fear at this point was that the village would escape his clutches. He ordered the bugler immediately to call the officers and form up the men for battle.</para>
<para id="fs-idm486396640">Around noon, Custer led the Seventh into the valley and divided his men as he had during the Battle of Washita. He sent Captain Benteen to the left with 120 men to block any escape while he and Major Marcus Reno advanced on the right along the Sun Dance Creek. They found a single tipi of an outlying part of the village and spotted 40 to 50 warriors fleeing toward the main village. Custer further divided his army, sending Reno in pursuit and himself continuing along the right flank. Inspiring his men with some bluster, Custer told them, ‚ÄúBoys, hold your horses. There are plenty of them down there for all of us.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm465680192">Reno‚Äôs men crossed the Little Bighorn and indiscriminately fired at noncombatants. Hundreds of Indian warriors started arriving. After drinking a copious amount of whiskey, a drunken Reno ordered his soldiers to dismount and form a skirmish line. They were outnumbered and were quickly overwhelmed by the American Indians‚Äô onslaught. Already running low on ammunition, Reno‚Äôs men retreated to the cover of some woods along the bank of the river but were soon flushed out, though 15 men remained there, hidden and frightened. The warriors routed Reno‚Äôs troops and killed and mutilated several during their pell-mell retreat back across the river. Reno organized 80 men on a hill and fought off several charges.</para>
<para id="fs-idm499327328">Benteen soon reinforced Reno during a lull in the fighting in the nearly 100-degree heat. The 15 men from the thicket also made it to what is now called Reno Hill, and the pack train with ammunition and supplies arrived as well. Benteen asked where Custer was, but Reno did not have a good answer. The men built entrenchments from ammunition and <term>hardtack</term> boxes, saddles, and even dead horses. For more than three hours they fought off constant attacks by hundreds of warriors and were relieved only by the arrival of darkness after 9 p.m. Reno‚Äôs men did an especially good job of digging entrenchments and barricades even though they were tired and thirsty.</para>
<para id="fs-idm493249104">The fierce attacks resumed around 2:30 a.m. on June 26 and lasted all morning. Benteen and Reno helped organize charges that temporarily drove off the Sioux and Cheyenne, and a few men desperately organized water parties down to the Little Bighorn under the blistering sun. The fighting lasted until mid-afternoon, when the warriors broke off to follow a large dust cloud that indicated the village was departing (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_09_03_LBighorn"/>). The soldiers on the hill feared it was a ruse and spent most of the night watching for the enemy‚Äôs return.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm351763536">General Terry‚Äôs army was camped to the north when his Crow scouts reported to him at sunrise on June 26 that they had found the battlefield where 200 men of the Seventh Regiment had been killed on what would become known as Last Stand Hill. The next day, Terry arrived at Last Stand Hill and wept at the news that Custer and his men were confirmed dead.</para>
<para id="fs-idm469115040">The bad news spread to the East, where it sobered the celebrations of the American centennial on the Fourth of July. The U.S. Army relentlessly pursued the Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne until it forced their surrender by applying military pressure and killing off buffalo herds. That year, Congress passed a bill claiming all the Black Hills and hunting lands of the 1868 treaty. Sitting Bull submitted to the U.S. government in 1881, and his authority as chief was no longer recognized. He was killed by Standing Rock Agency Indians in December 1890 just before the Battle of Wounded Knee.</para>
<para id="fs-idm319513904">The Indian Wars after the Civil War were devastating for American Indian tribes and their cultures. Their populations suffered heavy losses, and they lost their tribal grounds for hunting and agriculture. In the early twentieth century, the U.S. government restricted most Indians to reservations as Americans continued to settle the West. Many Americans saw the reservation system as a more humane alternative to war, but it wrought continued damage to American Indian cultures.</para>
