<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (5‚Äì10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm321894064">Prior to class, write the following passages on the board or project them for the whole class to consider (omitting the source reference for each). Also, print each of the two passages (omitting the source reference for each) on an index card and, as students enter the room, enlist two student volunteers‚Äîone to read each card aloud. Encourage the volunteer students to practice delivering their passages, preparing to read each in a tone that is serious but not overly dramatic or emotional and conveys sincere concern for the future of the United States. Card A source: Populist Party Platform, 1892; Card B source: Eugene V. Debs, ‚ÄúSocial Democracy,‚Äù <emphasis effect="italics">The National Magazine</emphasis>, October, 1898.</para>

<quote id="fs-idm458606960">The people are demoralized. . . public opinion silenced. . . labor impoverished. . . . The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few, unprecedented in the history of mankind; and the possessors of those, in turn, despise the republic and endanger liberty. From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed the two great classes‚Äîtramps and millionaires. . .</quote>

<quote id="fs-idm476567856">The millions of wage-earners do not own themselves, they are wage-slaves, and their masters control their lives and subject them to conditions as degrading as those which existed in times of chattel slavery. True it is that the united forces of labor could make themselves masters of the situation and change conditions to their liking, but divided on lines of political partisanship, intimidated, bulldozed, and bribed, they have done the bidding of the capitalist class, have been misled and betrayed by ignorant and dishonest leaders until hope has all but perished. . .</quote>
<para id="fs-idm337327264">After the student volunteers have read their passages, ask the class to point out similarities and differences between the two statements. For example, the statements are similar in that concern for poor and exploited workers is expressed in emphatic language. Have students discuss the language choices and the purpose of this kind of rhetoric. Ask what social and/or economic problems might have inspired the writer of each statement. Ask students to use their background knowledge to try to identify the source of each of the statements. After students have proposed and explained their reasoning for some possibilities, share the source information.</para>

<para id="fs-idm317385840">The Populist Party wrote their first national platform in 1892, and the Social Democratic Party wrote theirs in 1898. Have students list some of the worldwide and/or U.S. economic events and conditions that occurred in the 1870s‚Äì1890s and investigate cause- and-effect relationships that may have contributed to the more radical leaning of the Socialists as compared with those of the Populists. For example, how did the group identities differ between the two groups, and how might that difference in identity have affected their philosophical position regarding the proper role of government? For additional information about the history and geography of the Socialist Party of America, see the Mapping American Social Movements through the Twentieth Century webpage: <link url="http://depts.washington.edu/moves/SP_intro.shtml">http://depts.washington.edu/moves/SP_intro.shtml</link>.</para><para id="fs-idm624206000">The Populist Party disappeared in the early years of the twentieth century, largely because the Democratic Party absorbed some of the populist positions regarding desired reforms. Several of the reforms proposed by the populists in 1892 became law over the next few decades. However, the Socialist Party, though it has gone through several transitions, remains active into the twenty-first century. Have students consider which party has been more successful in influencing policy in the United States.</para>
