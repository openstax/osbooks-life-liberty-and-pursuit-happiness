<para id="fs-idm216894544">Air power dictated the American decision to assault the Japanese-held island of Iwo Jima early in 1945. The new B-29 bomber, developed at great cost to replace the standard B-17 used for bombing in Europe, possessed immense potential for altering the strategic balance of the war in the Pacific. The B-29 had a longer range and payload than its predecessor and was more heavily armed. It could soar to 30,000 feet to drop bombs, higher than enemy anti-aircraft weapons and fighters could reach‚Äîalthough the bombers would have trouble hitting their targets from that height.</para>
<para id="fs-idm232315952">Still, to reach Japan from the American-held Mariana Islands, aircraft had to detour around the Bonin Island chain, which included Iwo Jima, because of Japanese aircraft stationed there. However, capturing Iwo Jima instead of avoiding it would allow the Americans to use its airfields for refueling bombers on the way to Japan and back. It could also become a base for American fighter aircraft that could escort the bombers and allow them to drop bombs from a lower altitude‚Äîwithin range of enemy fighters, but far more accurately. Planners believed heavy and well-targeted bombing of Japan was a necessary prelude to invading the home islands (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_12_03_PacificMap"/>). In the Pacific, the American armed forces used the strategy of ‚Äúisland hopping,‚Äù fighting the Japanese on various Pacific Islands and thus closing in on Japan. Sometimes U.S. forces bypassed heavily fortified Japanese positions and concentrated on islands that were not well defended but were capable of supporting the drive to the Japanese mainland. They decided to fight on Iwo Jima.</para>

<para id="fs-idm215618464">The Japanese recognized the importance of the tiny volcanic island of Iwo Jima‚Äîa mere two-and-a-half by five miles in size‚Äîand intended to defend it to the utmost of their power. Instead of fighting the Americans on the beaches, however, Japanese troops intended to hold out in deep fortifications built far inland, killing thousands of Americans while their kamikaze suicide bombers inflicted terrible losses on the American fleet. The kamikaze, named after the ‚Äúdivine wind‚Äù that had scattered a Mongol fleet invading Japan in 1281, were young Japanese fliers who piloted their explosive-laden planes into American ships. Their introduction in October 1944 had been a mark of desperation by the Japanese, but they also shocked the Americans and were initially effective in sinking numerous vessels.</para>
<para id="fs-idm506433600">Three U.S. Marine divisions landed on Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945, and gradually worked their way inland. They faced heavy resistance that an air and naval bombardment failed to subdue because the Japanese were underground in their fortifications (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_12_03_IwoJima"/>). On February 23, the Marines succeeded in capturing the island‚Äôs primary landmark, the peak of Mount Suribachi.</para>

<para id="fs-idm194010752">Marines planted and raised a flag to mark their capture of the peak, to the delight of American witnesses, but a Japanese grenade attack interrupted them when the enemy heard the Americans cheer for the flag. Joe Rosenthal, a photographer from the Associated Press, then asked the Marines to repeat the ceremony for his camera. Six men‚Äîfive Marines and one U.S. Navy Corpsman‚Äîobliged for a series of photographs that soon became immortal and won Rosenthal a Pulitzer Prize (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_12_03_IwoFlag"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm219156144">The central photograph of the flag raising was reproduced thousands of times in the media for morale and propaganda purposes. For U.S. service members and the public generally, it symbolized the country‚Äôs resolve to continue fighting against formidable odds. Few realized it did not capture the actual event of the initial flag raising or all the soldiers engaged in that event. Nor, in fact, did the flag raising mark the end of the fighting for Iwo Jima, which, in fact, had barely begun. However, the symbol was arguably more important for the United States than the reality.</para>
<para id="fs-idm483266720">The capture of Mount Suribachi brought possession only of the southern tip of Iwo Jima. The rest of the island had to be captured before its airfields could be used without hindrance. But fighting continued for another month as the Marines advanced foot by foot, usually having to kill the Japanese soldiers within their entrenchments by the use of flamethrowers, satchel charges, and other heavy weapons. By the time the fighting ended on March 24, all but 200 of the Japanese garrison of approximately 20,000 troops had been killed. The Marines suffered terrible casualties as well; 6,000 were killed and about 25,000 wounded.</para>
<para id="fs-idm508855376">The Japanese had succeeded in slowing the inexorable American advance toward the home islands. One group, however, had failed to achieve its anticipated impact: the kamikaze. Thanks to Iwo Jima‚Äôs distance from Japan, suicide aircraft had been unable to reach the American fleet in significant numbers. But the Japanese took note, and when American forces invaded the island of Okinawa in April 1945, the kamikaze were ready and inflicted serious losses. For the Americans, the lessons of Iwo Jima and Okinawa were clear: invading Japan would entail total devastation on both sides because Japan would put up a suicidal defense of the islands to the last man. This realization played an important role in the later decision to use the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_12_03_Kamikaze"/>).</para>
