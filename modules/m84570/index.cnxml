<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm465761264">Republican Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, decisively defeating <term>incumbent</term> Democrat Jimmy Carter and independent candidate John Anderson and bringing a Republican Senate to Washington on his coattails. Reagan was reelected in a 49-state landslide in 1984, and his vice president, George H. W. Bush, won a solid victory in 1988 by promising to continue Reagan‚Äôs policies. The result was the crafting of domestic and foreign policies including smaller government, lower taxes, and a stronger national defense that the conservative movement had sought since the 1960s.</para>

<title>The Conservative Movement and Reaganomics</title>
<para id="fs-idm515276560">Reagan‚Äôs victory represented a long-term triumph for the conservative movement, which had grown more sophisticated and more powerful since Barry Goldwater‚Äôs failed presidential run in 1964. In his campaign, Reagan proposed limiting government, reducing the rate of growth of domestic spending, cutting taxes, and scaling back federal regulation of the economy. He advocated the conservative belief that dependence on <term>welfare</term> was damaging families, discouraging work, and inadvertently trapping people in poverty. He also argued for states‚Äô rights in a federal system and for strict construction of the Constitution. His Cold War foreign policy was <term>predicated</term> on ‚Äúpeace through strength,‚Äù promising to rebuild American military power and stop Soviet aggression around the world. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="">Comparing Presidential Campaign Advertising 1964‚Äì1980</link> Lesson.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm334071152">Reagan‚Äôs electoral coalition included traditional Republican groups such as middle-class suburbanites and small-business owners. He also broke apart the New Deal coalition, winning substantial support among overlapping groups including Catholics, working-class voters, and ethnic groups such as Italian Americans. Reagan added white evangelical Protestants to the Republican coalition, especially as Republicans gained strength in the Sun Belt. Although recession and inflation turned these groups away from the Democratic Party, they also moved toward Reagan on the basis of patriotism, anti-communism, and cultural issues such as opposition to abortion and banning of school prayer.</para>
<para id="fs-idm524603456">As president, Reagan won congressional approval of a package of tax and spending cuts that significantly changed the direction of federal policy (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_16_02_RReagan"/>). Initially, Congress passed a 25 percent across-the-board personal income tax cut over three years, indexed income taxes so inflation would not push taxpayers into higher tax brackets, and cut taxes on business. Later, Congress passed a comprehensive tax reform supported by Reagan that simplified the tax code and reduced tax rates again. From 1980 to 1990, discretionary domestic spending (e.g., grants to state and local governments) fell by one-third. Reagan‚Äôs administration also pursued deregulation and free trade. A final pillar of Reagan‚Äôs economic policy was support for anti-inflationary monetary policies enacted by the Federal Reserve Board. Reagan underscored his limited-government approach in 1981 by firing members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) after an illegal strike (federal law prohibits strikes by federal government employees), dealing a major blow to federal public-employee unions.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm522823376">In short, Reagan‚Äôs economic policies were held together by a commitment to the view that the economy would perform better if the free market was left to operate with less government intervention. Reagan also believed economic freedom and political freedom went hand in hand. Two schools of economic thought particularly influenced Reagan‚Äôs policies. The first was <term>monetarism</term>, which advocated restricting the money supply (and thus the availability of credit) to fight inflation, and the second was <term>supply-side economics</term>, which aimed to promote noninflationary economic growth by reducing taxes and regulations to encourage individuals and businesses to work, invest, and produce. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84564">Ronald Reagan and Supply-Side Economics</link> Narrative.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm512856224">High interest rates that were part of the Federal Reserve Board‚Äôs fight against staggering inflation rates contributed to a deep recession in 1981‚Äì1982, the second half of a ‚Äúdouble dip‚Äù recession that had started under Jimmy Carter in 1979‚Äì1980. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, and other members decided to attack rising prices by increasing interest rates, making money more difficult to borrow. Although the strategy was successful, American workers and the economy paid a high price. Unemployment reached nearly 11 percent. The Reagan administration also paid a high political price for its unpopular move, in the form of Democratic gains in the House of Representatives and state governorships in the 1982 midterm elections. However, a strong recovery began in early 1983 as the tax cuts took hold, and it continued for the rest of the decade. Nearly 20 million jobs were created, family incomes rose, and inflation and unemployment both fell dramatically.</para>

<title>Reagan‚Äôs Cold War Foreign Policy</title>
<para id="fs-idm365858704">At the same time, Reagan followed a foreign policy of ‚Äúpeace through strength,‚Äù supporting big increases in the defense budget and the deployment of new weapons systems. He presided over the largest peacetime defense budget in history‚Äîapproximately $220 billion in 1981 and increasing at 7 percent annually‚Äîwhich greatly enhanced American military readiness and modernization but contributed to growing federal deficits. He also embraced a research program called the <term>Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)</term>, intended to develop a defense against nuclear missiles. The Soviets objected strongly to SDI, but Reagan persisted, arguing for the moral superiority of a free society against Soviet <term>totalitarianism</term>. In 1983, he made a speech in which he <term>indicted</term> the Soviet Union as an ‚Äúevil empire,‚Äù and he frequently predicted that communism was doomed to collapse because of its economic inefficiency and denial of basic human freedom. Whereas previous administrations had embraced <term>d√©tente</term>, Reagan rejected that idea and instead pursued policies to facilitate the collapse of communism.</para>
<para id="fs-idm518794720">Reagan restored the policy of containment by strengthening traditional alliances with Western Europe and Japan, building a strategic partnership with China, and giving aid to the embattled government of El Salvador in its fight against Cuban-backed communist guerrillas. Going on the Cold War offensive, he announced the Reagan Doctrine, a policy of trying to roll back the Soviet empire by aiding anti-communist guerrillas in Afghanistan (the <emphasis effect="italics">mujahideen</emphasis>), Nicaragua (the ‚Äúcontras‚Äù), Cambodia, and Angola, countries that had fallen into the Soviet orbit in the 1970s. ‚ÄúWe must not break faith,‚Äù Reagan argued, ‚Äúwith those who are risking their lives‚Äîon every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua‚Äîto defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth.‚Äù He ordered the invasion of the Caribbean island country of Grenada when hardline communists seized power and killed the prime minister. The administration feared for the lives of American medical students on the island and especially a possible Soviet and Cuban military presence there (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_16_02_Grenada"/>). Reagan also approved a policy of economic warfare against the Soviet regime, including reducing its access to Western money and technology, with the aim of bringing about its downfall.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm515111536">After a series of aging leaders died in office in the early 1980s, a new generation took power in the Soviet Union. Mikhail Gorbachev, understanding that the collapsing Soviet economy and stagnating society were in need of reinvigoration, pursued a policy of <term><emphasis effect="italics">glasnost</emphasis></term> (openness) and <term><emphasis effect="italics">perestroika</emphasis></term> (economic restructuring with freer markets). He also proved open to a new relationship with the United States. Reagan and Gorbachev held summit meetings in Geneva in 1985, Reykjavik in 1986, Washington, DC, in 1987, and Moscow and New York in 1988. With Reagan pressuring the Soviet leader and the Russians unable to keep pace with western computer technology, the two agreed to make significant cuts in their nuclear arsenals.</para>
<para id="fs-idm473604208">In 1987, Reagan spoke at the Berlin Wall, which divided the city into free and communist sectors, calling on Gorbachev to ‚Äútear down this wall.‚Äù Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Gorbachev attempted to reform and save Soviet Communism through <emphasis effect="italics">glasnost</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">perestroika</emphasis>, but when the peoples of the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe embraced those principles, they undermined the repressive Communist regime. Two years later, mostly peaceful uprisings against communism swept over the Eastern European countries, and the Berlin Wall came down. Gorbachev decided to withdraw the Soviet army from the city and not intervene to repress the people who were fighting the puppet regimes of Eastern Europe for their liberties. Two years after that, the Soviet Union itself disintegrated. These events spelled the end of the Cold War between the two superpowers that had lasted since 1945. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84592">Ronald Reagan, ‚ÄúTear Down this Wall‚Äù Speech, June 12, 1987</link> Primary Source) (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84579">‚ÄúTear Down This Wall‚Äù: Ronald Reagan and the End of the Cold War</link> Decision Point.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm390464480">By that time, George H. W. Bush had been elected as Reagan‚Äôs successor. Bush focused largely on foreign affairs, especially managing the last stages of the fall of communism and dealing with a crisis in the Middle East. This began when Iraq‚Äôs dictator Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied neighboring Kuwait. Bush put together an international coalition that decisively defeated Saddam‚Äôs army and drove him from Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm.</para>
<para id="fs-idm329630624">Although the Reagan-Bush years produced some significant foreign policy successes, there were failures as well. A peacekeeping mission in Beirut, Lebanon, went awry when terrorists bombed a barracks, killing 241 U.S. Marines (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_16_02_Beirut"/>). Reagan was also entangled in the <term>Iran-Contra scandal</term> when it became known in late 1986 that National Security Adviser John Poindexter and Col. Oliver North had headed a secret operation that sold weapons to Iran, including 1,000 powerful anti-tank TOW missiles, for the release of hostages. Reagan denied knowledge of the operation in a televised address and news conference, which he recanted after it was discovered that he had approved it.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm658596256">The press soon made public that Poindexter and North had also funneled the proceeds of the arms sales to the Contras in Nicaragua during a period when Congress had legally banned military aid with the Boland Amendment. (The Boland Amendment had subsequently been reversed by congressional approval of military aid to the Contras in 1985.) Poindexter resigned, and Reagan fired North, but not before North shredded documents to obstruct the investigation. Reagan appointed the Tower Commission, which faulted the president for serious lapses in managing his administration. Reagan took responsibility for the scandal, and Congress launched an investigation. A defiant North testified at hearings during the summer of 1987 and won popular support. However, the Iran-Contra Affair contributed to growing distrust of government that originated in Lyndon Johnson‚Äôs credibility gap over the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal and Richard Nixon‚Äôs resignation. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m84565">The Iran-Contra Affair</link> Narrative) (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84593">Herblock, Cartoons of Ronald Reagan, 1984‚Äì1987</link> Primary Source.)</para>

<title>The 1980s Economy and Society</title>
<para id="fs-idm512896496">In the 1980s, the economy returned to rates of growth that had been common before the oil shock of 1973. The digital revolution in computers began, and the process of <term>deindustrialization</term>‚Äîthe transition in employment from industry to the service sector‚Äîcontinued. Partly because many American industrial jobs went overseas to countries with cheaper labor, the proportion of American workers in labor unions declined significantly, changing the dynamics of labor-management relations. Moreover, many industrial towns across the United States were hit hard by widespread unemployment. At the same time, women joined the workforce in rapidly increasing numbers and entered new fields. A new and much-satirized archetype emerged, the ‚Äúyuppie‚Äù (young urban professional), as the symbol of what critics saw as a new era of greed. Others saw the era differently, as a rebirth of freedom and opportunity. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84578">Tech Giants: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates</link> Narrative.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm462388080">Like the nation‚Äôs foreign policy, its growing economy during the decade was tempered by shortcomings. These included rising income inequality (a trend that had begun in the early 1970s), a crisis in the savings and loan industry that required an expensive government bailout, and a steep, though short-lived, stock market decline in late 1987. The federal debt also grew significantly during the decade, with a number of factors contributing. Defense spending increased, as did automatic entitlement spending on social programs. Tax cuts slowed the growth of government tax revenue, and the recession of 1981‚Äì1982 reduced revenue as well. The annual deficit then fell with the booming economy and spending restraint, though the federal debt continued to grow. After a new spurt in the early 1990s, the federal deficit shrank throughout the decade after several deficit-reduction packages were adopted during the Bush and Clinton administrations, aided by a stock market and economic boom fueled by growing technology companies and low interest rates.</para>
<para id="fs-idm471903184">Demographic trends also changed the United States. In keeping with economic deindustrialization, the nation saw a continued shift of population from the Rust Belt states of the Northeast and Midwest to the Sun Belt states of the South and West as people moved in search of jobs and opportunity. There was also a new burst of immigration, this time from Latin America and Asia. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was a compromise reform that gave amnesty to illegal immigrants then in the United States and imposed penalties on businesses for hiring illegal immigrants in the future. A few years later, the Immigration Act of 1990 attempted to connect immigration more closely to job skills by easing the way into the country for more highly educated workers.</para>
<para id="fs-idm473577008">The ongoing ‚Äúculture war‚Äù between liberals and conservatives over social values was multifaceted. The debate over abortion continued, with two Supreme Court decisions, <term><emphasis effect="italics">Missouri v. Webster</emphasis></term> (1989) and <term><emphasis effect="italics">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</emphasis></term> (1992), narrowing but not overturning <term><emphasis effect="italics">Roe v. Wade</emphasis></term> (1973), which had legalized abortion. A debate over family structure and single motherhood erupted when Vice President Dan Quayle criticized the television show <emphasis effect="italics">Murphy Brown</emphasis> for featuring a single mother. The emergence of AIDS in the 1980s brought to the forefront questions about society‚Äôs acceptance of homosexuality. College campuses became ground zero in battles over diversity, multiculturalism, the teaching of western civilization courses, and affirmative action, which had been an object of controversy even before the Supreme Court‚Äôs <term><emphasis effect="italics">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</emphasis></term> decision in 1978.</para>

<para id="fs-idm389749744"><term>Affirmative action</term> and quotas in employment also returned as an issue due to a 1989 Supreme Court decision and subsequent passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which was criticized as promoting quotas. The plight of people with disabilities seeking to use public services was addressed when Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990 (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_16_02_GBushADA"/>). The act banned discrimination against people with disabilities, required employers to make reasonable accommodations, and mandated accessibility for public accommodations. Religion remained part of the ‚Äúculture war,‚Äù as the ‚Äúreligious right‚Äù continued to organize to influence the Republican Party and the Democratic Party became increasingly secularized.

<title>The Presidency of Bill Clinton</title>
<para id="fs-idm472526768">The string of consecutive Republican presidential victories ended in 1992 when Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, running on a moderate platform as a ‚ÄúNew Democrat,‚Äù defeated George H. W. Bush‚Äôs bid for reelection. Bush was hurt by a short recession, by a tax increase that broke a 1988 campaign pledge, and, ironically, by the successful end of the Cold War, which reduced the importance of foreign policy, his strong suit. Ready for a change, some voters looked for a populist outsider who seemed to represent the people more closely than either political party. As a result, they gave nearly one in five votes to independent candidate H. Ross Perot, a billionaire Texan who was a populist outsider. Whether Perot drew more votes from Bush or Clinton remains a matter for debate, but Clinton, who projected empathy and optimism, won the election with 43 percent of the popular vote. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m84569">The 1992 Presidential Election and the Rise of Democratic Populism</link> Narrative.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm509559296">In his first two years in the White House, Clinton gained enactment of the <term>North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</term> with Canada and Mexico, which created a free-trade zone on January 1, 1994, by immediately eliminating tariffs between the nations or gradually phasing them out. Otherwise, he governed from the left, working with the Democratic Congress to pass another large tax increase. Clinton also issued an order allowing gay people to serve openly in the military, but he soon backtracked due to congressional opposition and settled for a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù policy. He put First Lady Hillary Clinton in charge of a task force that proposed a major overhaul of the health care system. Opponents labeled it ‚ÄúClintoncare‚Äù and argued it was too expensive, too bureaucratic, and too likely to disrupt the health care system. It was never brought up for a vote and died in committee.</para>
<para id="fs-idm523293072">In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans won a majority in both the House and the Senate for the first time since 1952. The Republican victory was framed by the ‚Äú<term>Contract with America</term>,‚Äù a promise by House Republican candidates, engineered by House Minority Whip and soon-to-be Speaker Newt Gingrich, that they would bring to a vote a number of conservative reforms and policy departures, including a new push for a balanced budget (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_16_02_SOTU1997"/>).</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm660860224">There were major struggles between Congress and the Clinton administration, but two important policy changes emerged. First, a welfare reform bill was enacted that gave states broad authority to design their own programs and impose work requirements and time limits on recipients of cash welfare. Second, after the 1996 elections, Clinton and Republicans reached an agreement leading to a balanced federal budget in 1998 for the first time since 1969. However, scandals starting with the Whitewater land deal and continuing with allegations of sexual misconduct that led to Clinton‚Äôs impeachment by the House on the grounds that he committed perjury and obstruction of justice. In December 1998, Clinton joined Andrew Johnson to become only the second sitting president to be impeached. However, like Andrew Johnson and Donald J. Trump, who would be impeached more than 20 years later, he was not removed from office by the Senate.</para>
<para id="fs-idm497686816">The economy picked up speed as the 1990s wore on, and the nation enjoyed another long expansion, driven largely by technology. This growth was further accelerated by decreased federal spending during the Clinton administration, especially after the 1994 elections, as well as lower interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, which contributed to the tech boom and a rapidly growing stock market. Moreover, NAFTA encouraged trade with Canada and Mexico, though some industrial jobs and factories may have moved to Mexico as a result.</para>
<para id="fs-idm386261088">At the end of the decade, the ‚Äúdot-com bubble‚Äù in the stock market burst as overpriced technology company shares collapsed in value, but the influence of technology on the economy did not abate. The internet and cell phones, nearly invisible in 1990, were <term>ubiquitous</term> in 2000 and remained so. Consumers rapidly purchased goods and services online over the next few decades as e-commerce dramatically increased, having a significant impact on brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls.</para>
<para id="fs-idm510459360">After Operation Desert Storm, U.S. foreign policy in the 1990s entered a period of relative calm for America. Some analysts argued that that Americans were witnessing the ‚Äúend of history,‚Äù the final victory of liberal democracy, and had largely lost interest in foreign affairs. Nevertheless, the United States was still engaged in world affairs and wars around the world. The Clinton administration intervened abroad to support democracy and to solve humanitarian crises in Haiti, Somalia, and the Balkans. Clinton withdrew U.S. forces from Somalia after they were attacked in Mogadishu and suffered approximately 100 casualties in urban fighting, but he backed NATO bombing campaigns to stop ethnic cleansing (i.e., genocide) in Bosnia and Kosovo.

<para id="fs-idm509935520">Saddam Hussein remained an adversary in the Middle East; Clinton ordered an extensive bombing campaign against Iraq in 1998 when Saddam expelled U.N. weapons inspectors. Meanwhile, Islamic terrorism gained new strength, most visibly in the rise of the al-Qaeda network headed by Osama bin Laden. In February 1993, Islamic fundamentalist terrorists bombed New York‚Äôs World Trade Center, and al-Qaeda attacked U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Two years later, al-Qaeda attacked the U.S.S. <emphasis effect="italics">Cole</emphasis>, a navy vessel at port in Yemen, killing 17 American sailors and wounding more than 30 others (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_16_02_Cole"/>).

<title>George W. Bush and a Changing World</title>
<para id="fs-idm526115488">George W. Bush, governor of Texas and son of George H. W. Bush, ran for president in a hotly contested 2000 race against Vice President Al Gore. After two recounts and intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court in <term><emphasis effect="italics">Bush v. Gore</emphasis></term> (2000), Bush was declared the winner in the decisive state of Florida, giving him the required majority in the Electoral College. Bush had run on a theme of ‚Äúcompassionate conservatism.‚Äù As president, he combined traditionally liberal and conservative domestic policies, including a large tax cut, a major expansion of federal involvement in elementary and secondary education through the No Child Left Behind Act, and an expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage. He also defended traditional marriage and made an unsuccessful proposal to privatize Social Security by establishing personal accounts for workers.</para>
<para id="fs-idm494272352">However, most of Bush‚Äôs presidency was consumed by the War on Terror, the United States‚Äô response to al-Qaeda‚Äôs attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001 (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_16_02_GroundZero"/>). Bush‚Äôs external response initially focused on attacking al-Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan, which the terrorist group had used as safe haven. The Taliban regime was toppled in short order and al-Qaeda was driven into hiding, but fighting continued. In 2003, fearing that Saddam Hussein retained a large stockpile of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and was friendly with terrorists, Bush received authorization from Congress to invade Iraq. Saddam‚Äôs dictatorship there was quickly toppled, but U.S. forces did not find the WMDs they expected. The Bush administration then shifted the primary rationale for the invasion to spreading democracy and peace in the Middle East. After the successful overthrow of the regime, U.S. forces encountered an insurgency from supporters of Saddam as well as al-Qaeda in Iraq. Facing a deteriorating situation with heavy U.S. casualties from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), Bush ordered a surge of additional troops that turned the tide of battle in 2007.

<para id="fs-idm353054240">After the initial success, the Iraq War became increasingly controversial among Americans, as did the Bush Administration‚Äôs policies for dealing with detained terrorists or ‚Äúenemy combatants.‚Äù One controversy was over the indefinite holding of detainees at a U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Moreover, the administration used ‚Äúenhanced interrogation‚Äù techniques that many Americans saw as torture. In several Supreme Court cases, including <emphasis effect="italics">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Rasul v. Bush, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">Boumediene v. Bush</emphasis>, the Supreme Court placed limits on the president‚Äôs executive discretion and insisted that enemy combatants had certain <term>habeas corpus</term> rights.</para>
<para id="fs-idm327741616">At home, the War on Terror led to increased efforts to investigate and stop terrorism through new government agencies such as the Transportation Safety Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. The <term>National Security Administration (NSA)</term> conducted a controversial telephone surveillance program of American citizens that some thought was a violation of individual civil liberties. In 2001, Congress passed the <term>USA PATRIOT Act</term>, which gave law enforcement stronger tools to fight terrorism through ‚Äúroving wiretaps‚Äù on multiple devices in a single authorization and ‚Äúsneak and peak‚Äù warrants that allowed searches and seizures in homes and businesses without the authorization or consent of the owner. These provisions led to concerns that civil liberties related to privacy and the Fourth Amendment were being compromised. Congress renewed the act several times during the Bush and Obama administrations. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m84575">The USA PATRIOT Act</link> Narrative.)

<para id="fs-idm379489104">A severe financial crisis erupted in fall 2008, connected to the bursting of a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù in the housing market. The Bush administration met the crisis in several ways. The federal government lent money to struggling investment bank Bear Stearns and insurance company AIG and took over the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congress then passed the <term>Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)</term>, which authorized $700 billion and ultimately provided $431 billion to struggling financial institutions to keep them open (this money was later repaid to the government). TARP helped stabilize the financial system, but these efforts could not avert what came to be called the Great Recession, a steep economic decline that was followed by a long period of sluggish growth.</para>

<title>The Great Recession and the Presidency of Barack Obama</title>
<para id="fs-idm515103712">Democrats regained control of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections, and in 2008, U.S. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois was elected the first African American president. Obama won the election because of the growing unpopularity of the war in Iraq and the early suffering caused by the recession. Although he withdrew U.S. forces from Iraq as promised during the campaign, Obama returned U.S. military forces there when a new terrorist threat, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), swept toward Baghdad in 2014.</para>
<para id="fs-idm520251488">In Afghanistan, Obama sought to prevent the return of the Taliban to power and end the haven it provided for al-Qaeda, authorizing a surge of 33,000 troops to that country. Starting in 2011, he gradually began to draw down forces in Afghanistan. During the election, he had also promised to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. However, Congress kept Guantanamo Bay open. Obama‚Äôs greatest success in the ongoing War on Terror came when he authorized a U.S. special forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 in Pakistan.</para>
<para id="fs-idm349128816">The situation in the Middle East continued to evolve rapidly. In early 2011, protesters seeking greater liberties and an end to corruption and brutality forced the resignation of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. The movement, called the Arab Spring, quickly spread to Libya, where the United States launched air strikes to support the popular uprisings that led to the overthrow of dictator, Muammar el-Qaddafi. However, a large mob attacked the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, and four Americans were slain. Although initially unsure about supporting groups rebelling against Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, who used chemical weapons against the rebels, Obama later ordered air strikes (on the basis of the congressional authorization from the War on Terror in 2001) when ISIS established a greater presence in Syria.</para>
<para id="fs-idm362023760">Obama hoped to transform American politics and end the era begun by the ‚ÄúReagan Revolution‚Äù in 1980. To that end, he won approval of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), a New Deal‚Äìstyle stimulus spending program to fight the recession that was initially authorized at $787 billion and eventually spent a total of $840 billion. Components of the ARRA included tax cuts, infrastructure spending, aid to state and local governments, and subsidies to green energy companies. In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Congress passed several regulations on the financial sector, including Wall Street, banks, and insurance companies, to decrease the likelihood of a similar financial meltdown.</para>
<para id="fs-idm494547232">In 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), a government program that expanded health care coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, creating health care exchanges, providing the uninsured with subsidies to purchase insurance, expanding Medicaid, and requiring that insurance companies cover individuals‚Äô preexisting conditions. The program sought to lower costs by mandating that all individuals carry health insurance and thereby ensure that a sufficient number of healthy people were part of the system. This individual mandate imposed a penalty in the form of a fine or a tax to those who did not have coverage. Critics nicknamed the program ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù and feared expanded government regulation in health care and escalated federal spending. Those concerns, and voters‚Äô reaction against weak economic growth, led to major Democratic losses in Congress in the midterms. Energized by the right-leaning Tea Party movement (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_16_02_TeaParty"/>), which called for reduced spending, taxes, and debt and a return to constitutionalism, Republicans won a House majority in 2010 and a Senate majority in 2014.</para>

<para id="fs-idm387401168">The Republican House stalled Obama‚Äôs legislative program and forced him to accept significant spending cuts in 2011, but his reelection in 2012 guaranteed survival of the ACA through at least 2016. Faced with an impasse in Congress, Obama turned increasingly to executive orders and regulatory actions on issues such as immigration and climate change to institute his policies. He also advanced his agenda through the courts, which upheld ACA (though with limits) and ruled in <term><emphasis effect="italics">Obergefell v. Hodges</emphasis></term> (2015) that same-sex marriage was a constitutional right. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84576">Fossil Fuels, Foreign Policy, and Climate Change</link> Narrative.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm380185776">Social tensions and polarization increased as the Occupy Wall Street movement called for action against the wealthiest ‚Äú1 percent‚Äù and the Black Lives Matter movement protested incidents of police racism and excessive force against African Americans. In the August 2014 incident that launched the Black Lives Matter movement, an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Riots ensued, and Missouri governor Jay Nixon called in the National Guard. In November, a grand jury decided not to indict the police officer, and a subsequent March 2015 report by the Obama Justice Department concluded that Brown had assaulted the officer before the shooting and that the officer did not use unreasonable force while shooting and killing Brown. However, the Justice Department severely criticized racial bias in the department‚Äôs policing methods. By the end of Obama‚Äôs presidency, most Americans said race relations had continued to deteriorate.</para>
<para id="fs-idm333762896">Abroad, Obama opened diplomatic ties with Cuba for the first time since 1961. He also supported some opposition forces in the Syrian civil war and proclaimed a ‚Äúred line‚Äù against chemical weapon use by the Syrian regime; but Syrian dictator Bashir Assad used such weapons on his own people anyway. Obama signed a deal with Iran that relieved economic sanctions in exchange for an Iranian promise to suspend its nuclear weapons program. Obama also announced a reset of relations with Russia soon after taking office, but he found himself at odds with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea, proxy war in eastern Ukraine, and support of Syria‚Äôs Assad (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_16_02_ObamaPutin"/>). Overall, Obama sought to pursue a foreign policy that de-emphasized unilateral use of American power and that sought reconciliation with many traditional adversaries of the United States, a challenging task for any president.</para>

<para id="fs-idm336259328">The 2016 election saw Donald Trump win the presidency on the basis of a wave of populism in the United States and abroad embraced by millions who felt left behind by globalism and the information economy and betrayed by successful elites. The long-term impact on politics, economics, and culture remains to be seen.</para>
<para id="fs-idm513757872">From 1980 to the present, American society experienced a burst of technological change, hurtling into the digital age. Women became more fully integrated into the nation‚Äôs workforce, many industrial jobs moved overseas, and mass immigration changed the nation‚Äôs demography, increasing the proportion of racial and ethnic minorities in the population. A series of ongoing debates dominated American politics. Was the federal government too powerful, or should it do more at home? Was America better served by moral traditionalism or by the <term>ethos</term> of the 1960s counterculture? Should America act forcefully abroad in defense of freedom, democracy, and its national interests, or should it be more cautious? These questions touched upon the perennial questions that Americans faced since the founding of the country. They would continue to face difficult questions and debate solutions to them.
