<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (5‚Äì10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm343336544">Draw a Venn diagram on the board, similar to the following:</para>
<figure id="BRI_APUSH_09_07_VennRights" class="scaled-down-60">
<media id="fs-idm354309488" alt="The figure shows three overlapping circles. The top circle is labeled Natural Rights, the bottom left circle is labeled Civil Rights, and the bottom right circle is labeled Political Rights.">

</media>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm323985056">Depending on student background, lead a brief discussion of the three kinds of rights and their interrelationships. Have students suggest rights that might go in each circle. Don‚Äôt get too caught up in the details of exactly what goes in the overlapping parts of the circles; it is enough at this point just to acknowledge that the types of rights are interrelated and that natural rights take precedence.</para>
<para id="fs-idm323903024">Conclude this part of the lesson by writing the following definitions on the board so students have them for reference throughout the lesson.</para>
<para id="fs-idm314452640">Natural rights: Rights that belong to individuals by nature and can only be justly abridged through due process. Examples are equality, life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.</para>
<para id="fs-idm361970960">Civil rights: Rights that belong to individuals by virtue of being members of a certain community. Examples include protections from discrimination, privacy, and the freedom of press and speech.</para>
<para id="fs-idm460977504">Political rights: Rights individuals may use to participate in their own governance. Examples are petitioning the government, voting, serving on a jury, and holding office.</para>

Assign the readings as best fits your teaching situation (e.g., small groups, jigsaw).

<title>III. Application (10‚Äì25 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm339140944">Depending on the method you used to have students do the initial reading and analysis, conduct a discussion that allows students to consider all the documents and share their responses to the questions in the packet. They may share their responses as a whole class, in the second stage of jigsaw groups, through inner and outer circle fishbowl discussion, and so forth.</para>

<list id="fs-idm358680144" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>Summarize the government actions in the Civil and Political Rights timeline, regarding change over time in the Gilded Age (1877‚Äì1898). (Accept reasoned responses. Students may say that Congress appeared to be moving to guarantee equality until the mid-1870s, but by that time, interests opposed to the changes had grown louder and challenged them in court. The Supreme Court interpreted narrowly the guarantees of the Reconstruction Amendments, blunting their efficacy.)</item>
<item>The actions in the Economic Freedom timeline relate to government regulations motivated by concern for the public interest. Why do you think laws intended to secure an even playing field for workers and consumers ended up being used to protect the interests of big business? Reflect on the Supreme Court‚Äôs analysis of these cases. What generalizations can you make regarding the Court‚Äôs interpretation of relevant constitutional principles? What are your observations regarding change over time within the period addressed? (Accept reasoned responses. Note that political considerations should have been minimized, because federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, are appointed for a term of ‚Äúgood behavior‚Äù (Article 3, Section 1), which usually means a lifetime tenure. What other forces could influence the development of the law over time?)</item>
