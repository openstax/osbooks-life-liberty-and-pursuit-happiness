<para id="fs-idm904310880">‚ÄúSeparate but equal‚Äù had been the law of the land since the <emphasis effect="italics">Plessy v. Ferguson</emphasis> decision of 1896 affirmed the system of state-sanctioned racial segregation in the South and some parts of the North that historians have called ‚ÄúJim Crow.‚Äù This policy was clearly seen in public education, with separate schools for white and black students that were hardly equal. In <emphasis effect="italics">Brown v. Board of Education</emphasis> (1954), the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that ‚Äúin the field of public education, the doctrine of ‚Äôseparate but equal‚Äô has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal‚Äù (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_15_03_Lawyers"/>). The following year, in its <emphasis effect="italics">Brown II</emphasis> decision, the Court declared that desegregation must happen ‚Äúwith all deliberate speed,‚Äù a term filled with great ambiguity.</para>

<para id="fs-idm213107984">White southerners took it to mean that there was no urgency on school desegregation, and few southern schools integrated immediately after the <emphasis effect="italics">Brown</emphasis> decisions. Instead, white southerners followed a policy of ‚Äúmassive resistance‚Äù to integration, which included some southern districts closing their public schools rather than integrating. In 1956, approximately 100 members of Congress signed the <term>‚ÄúSouthern Manifesto‚Äù</term> opposing the Supreme Court‚Äôs <emphasis effect="italics">Brown</emphasis> decision as a ‚Äúclear abuse of judicial power.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm228037872">In 1957, the attempt by the Little Rock, Arkansas, Board of Education to integrate its public high school with nine African American students met with fierce resistance from local whites and Governor Orval Faubus. In response, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered units of the Army‚Äôs 101st Airborne to Little Rock to protect the black students and make sure that the integration plan was implemented.</para>
<para id="fs-idm224805968">At the grassroots level, the <emphasis effect="italics">Brown</emphasis> decision helped pave the way for the end of Jim Crow laws by igniting the civil rights movement that eventually led to the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Still, as late as the early 1960s, white resistance to integration meant that only a small percentage of black children were attending integrated schools in the South. Once schools were legally integrated, residential and demographic factors often meant that many African American students still went to schools that were mostly black. In the South, after the <emphasis effect="italics">Brown</emphasis> decision, whites also created private schools for their children that did not have to comply with court-ordered integration, so there were fewer white students enrolled in public schools (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_15_03_LRProtest"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm787488624">Charlotte, North Carolina, had moved early to integrate its schools. However, residential housing patterns meant that black students were mostly concentrated in the central Charlotte area and attended mostly black schools even after legal segregation had ended. White students mostly lived outside the center city and attended mostly white schools. The NAACP challenged these racially imbalanced schools in court, and a judge ordered the city to create a plan to integrate the schools. The case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously in <term><emphasis effect="italics">Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</emphasis></term> (1971) that busing was a legitimate tool to achieve racial integration in schools.</para>
<para id="fs-idm906600480">In Charlotte and many other southern cities, busing plans were implemented to transport white and black children across districts and neighborhoods to ensure all schools were racially balanced, meaning they had an appropriate mix of students of both races as determined by the courts (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_15_03_Bus"/>). Simply ending state-sanctioned segregation in schools was no longer enough. Courts were now moving away from race-neutral actions that had ended <term>de jure</term> segregation and toward enforcing racial quotas for individual schools. Courts were also becoming more active in designing desegregation plans for specific schools and even taking over basic duties of local school districts such as teacher assignments. Many parents who wanted their children to attend public schools close to home thought these judicial orders imposed an unfair burden on their sons and daughters.</para>

<para id="fs-idm257960080">During the 1960s, the battle for school integration began to turn to northern cities, which largely did not have a legalized system of racially segregated schools prior to <emphasis effect="italics">Brown</emphasis>. However, residential housing patterns, a growing African American population in the inner city, and a corresponding <term>‚Äúwhite flight‚Äù</term> of middle-class residents to the suburbs meant that northern urban districts were seeing increasing numbers of racially imbalanced schools. Many inner-city schools were now increasingly populated by mostly black and minority students. By the early 1970s, cities like Denver and Detroit found themselves under court-ordered desegregation plans.</para>
<para id="fs-idm901016112">Because Detroit by this time had become a majority-black city, the lower courts ordered a desegregation plan that would consolidate suburban school districts with the Detroit district, allowing for busing across city lines to achieve racial balance. In the 1974 decision <emphasis effect="italics">Milliken v. Bradley</emphasis>, the Supreme Court struck down the Detroit metropolitan plan imposed by the lower court and said that suburban districts could not be forced into such desegregation plans as long as they were not found liable for any overt discrimination. The decision limited the extent of desegregation measures for the first time and meant that any desegregation plans in northern cities would have to take place within school district lines.</para>
<para id="fs-idm910790864">One of the most controversial busing cases occurred in Boston, Massachusetts. The city had abolished legal segregation in its schools in the 1850s. However, by the 1960s, as the city‚Äôs African American population grew, neighborhood schools became increasingly racially imbalanced, and many of the majority-black schools were seen as inadequate and not serving the needs of their students. In 1965, the Massachusetts state legislature passed the Racial Imbalance Act, which declared any school that was more than 50 percent nonwhite to be racially imbalanced. Schools that were overwhelmingly white‚Äîthat is, most suburban schools‚Äîwere not included under the law, meaning that the law‚Äôs impact was mostly felt in large cities such as Boston.</para>
<para id="fs-idm911073792">The NAACP challenged the Boston School Committee, arguing that it actively maintained a system of racial segregation in city schools. The Boston School Committee refused to admit there were any problems with the racial balance in city schools. In 1974, U.S. District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity ruled in favor of the NAACP and found that the Boston School Committee had enacted polices that reinforced residential patterns of racial segregation in the city. Garrity ordered a plan to desegregate the schools through redistricting and busing of students.</para>
<para id="fs-idm228511424">Boston was made up of many tight-knit and insular white ethnic neighborhoods that strongly opposed Judge Garrity‚Äôs plan and supported local neighborhood schools. For instance, South Boston, a heavily working-class, Irish Catholic neighborhood, became a center of antibusing activism. Groups such as <term>Restore Our Alienated Rights (ROAR)</term> were formed to oppose the busing plan. They planned protest marches and used tactics of civil disobedience similar to those of the civil rights movement in an effort to stop the busing plan. Garrity‚Äôs busing plan ‚Äúpaired‚Äù the mostly African American neighborhood of Roxbury with the largely Irish American neighborhood of South Boston. South Boston became the hub of opposition to busing. Opponents of busing tended to be mostly working-class white Bostonians who felt they were being made to bear the brunt of integration while more affluent residents and suburbanites were immune from its impact. The busing controversy led to increasing racial tensions between blacks and whites that occasionally broke out in violence.</para>
<para id="fs-idm218860576">More than a decade after Garrity‚Äôs decision, Boston regained control over its schools; the last remnants of school busing in Boston were finally eliminated in 2013. The busing controversy accelerated white flight from Boston, with the schools losing almost 50 percent of their student body after 1975 and white students constituting less than 15 percent of the school population, down from more than 60 percent in 1970. For all the years of controversy and protest, Boston‚Äôs schools had little to show in terms of improved educational outcomes for students.</para>
<para id="fs-idm222104256">Popular and political support for busing declined nationwide as America entered a more politically conservative era. In subsequent decisions after 1990, the Supreme Court took up school desegregation cases dealing with Oklahoma City, Kansas City, and Seattle. In all these cases, the Court proved reluctant to remedy racially imbalanced schools. In 2000, a federal judge ordered that the Charlotte, North Carolina, school busing plan be ended and replaced with a system of school choice. Courts were less willing to entertain policies that were explicitly race-based, such as racial quotas, to racially balance schools. The history of busing in the 1970s exposed racial fault lines in American society after the successes of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.</para>
