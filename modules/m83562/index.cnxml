<para id="fs-idm349752832">Read the source introduction together and then have students complete the sourcing questions independently. These have been designed to reflect the sourcing analysis of the <link url="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-us-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf">APUSH DBQ</link>. After students have completed the sourcing questions divide them into pairs or small groups to read the document (or document sections) and complete the comprehension questions. Introduce the key question (How did the Fourteen Points respond to the causes of World War I and attempt to prevent future wars?) so that students consider this as they read the document. To save time, different students groups could be assigned Points I – V (peaceful relations), Points VI – VIII (conquered territory), Points X – XIII (self-determinism). Point XIV (League of Nations) could be added to the conquered territory group as this is the shortest section. After students complete the comprehension questions have them answer the Historical Analysis questions and be prepared to explain specifically how different points address major causes of World War I and/or how the point attempts to secure lasting international peace. At the end review the Fourteen Points and conduct a discussion focusing on reflection questions such as these:</para>

<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm341364576">President Woodrow Wilson wrote the Fourteen Points as a program to preserve peace after World War I. Wilson first presented the Fourteen Points in a speech to Congress on January 8, 1918, in what would be the final year of the war. Wilson hoped the end of the war would be an opportunity to not only establish a peace treaty but also create a just and cooperative international order to prevent future wars in Europe and the rest of the world. American allies viewed the Fourteen Points positively and even the Central Powers began to see it as a reasonable basis for peace when they realized the war was unwinnable. Although all sides initially supported the ideas presented in the Fourteen Points, demands for German reparations and other punishments made the idealism of the Fourteen Points difficult to implement at the Peace of Paris.</para>
