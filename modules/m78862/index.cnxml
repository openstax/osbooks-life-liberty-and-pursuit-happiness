Teachers may choose to use the provided questions as scaffolds for students or remove them as best suits their teaching situation. The documents may be used in isolation or in combinations as the teacher sees fit. It is recommended that, after the warm-up activity analyzing a few relevant constitutional passages, the teacher model the process of analyzing the landmark case excerpts by working through Document 1, <emphasis effect="italics">Marbury v. Madison</emphasis> (1803) with the class as a whole, and then have students complete the remaining document analyses individually or in groups.</para>
