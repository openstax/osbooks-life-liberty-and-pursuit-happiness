<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm242448544">In the 1790s, the Washington and Adams administrations pursued a policy of neutrality in foreign affairs. Neutrality not only was a guiding principle in the early republic but a necessity: The United States did not maintain an army or navy strong enough to realistically repel foreign attacks. In the early 1800s, the Napoleonic Wars in Europe consumed the attention of most of the great powers for more than a decade. As a result, Spain had difficulty retaining control over its imperial possessions in North and South America. Over the first several decades of the nineteenth century, the people in several countries revolted against Spanish rule and gained independence. In theory, the U.S. government supported those revolutions because it believed independence would allow the United States, rather than Europe, to expand both its territory and its influence in the western hemisphere. In 1823, President James Monroe, fearing Russian designs on the Northwest and European designs on the new republics of Latin America, issued what came to be called the Monroe Doctrine, warning European powers from intervening in the affairs of the western hemisphere in order to prevent threats to American trade and national security.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">The political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this respect from that of America. <link target-id="fs-idm263636560">This difference proceeds from that which exists in their respective Governments; and to the defense of our own, which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure, and matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens, and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity, this whole nation is devoted</link>.</entry>

With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the Governments who have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, <link target-id="fs-idm265076944">we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly <emphasis effect="bold">disposition</emphasis> toward the United States</link>.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Our policy in regard to Europe, which was adopted at an early stage of the wars which have so long <emphasis effect="bold">agitated</emphasis> that quarter of the globe, nevertheless remains the same, which is, <link target-id="fs-idm261549408">not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its powers; to consider the government <emphasis effect="bold">de facto</emphasis> as the legitimate government for us; to cultivate friendly relations with it, and to preserve those relations by a frank, firm, and manly policy, meeting in all instances the just claims of every power, submitting to injuries from none</link>.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">But in regard to those continents circumstances are eminently and <emphasis effect="bold">conspicuously</emphasis> different. It is impossible that the allied powers should extend their political system to any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and happiness; nor can anyone believe that our southern brethren, if left to themselves, would adopt it of their own accord. It is equally impossible, therefore, that we should behold such interposition in any form with indifference. If we look to the comparative strength and resources of Spain and those new Governments, and their distance from each other, it must be obvious that she can never subdue them. <link target-id="fs-idm273397536">It is still the true policy of the United States to leave the parties to themselves, in hope that other powers will pursue the same course</link>.</entry>
