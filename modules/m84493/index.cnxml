<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm267256992">On March 12, 1947, President Harry S. Truman addressed the U.S. Congress, proposing immediate economic and military aid to governments threatened by Communist insurrections in the aftermath of World War II. This was in direct response to the Soviet expansion into Greece and Turkey, which ultimately laid the foundation for the Cold War. Congress responded to Truman’s proposal by authorizing the European Recovery Program, better known as the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan was a four-year program intended to help rebuild the economies of Western Europe after the war. Congress approved the plan, which was aimed at rebuilding industry, removing trade barriers, and restoring prosperity as quickly as possible in the region. One objective was to restore U.S. trade partners, but equally important was blunting the appeal of communism in the war-torn nations.</para>
