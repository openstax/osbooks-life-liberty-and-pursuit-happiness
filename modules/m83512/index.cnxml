<para id="fs-idm250083808">Mary Boykin Chesnut was born Mary Boykin Miller on March 31, 1823, in South Carolina (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_08_03_MChesnut"/>). Her father, Stephen Decatur Miller, was a politician who promoted states‚Äô rights and argued in favor of the position‚Äîheld by other southerners such as John Calhoun‚Äîthat slavery was a ‚Äúpositive good.‚Äù Miller became governor of South Carolina in 1828 and a U.S. senator in 1830. As the daughter of an elite southerner, Chesnut was educated in Charleston, South Carolina, at Madame Talvande‚Äôs French School for Young Ladies. She was a celebrated beauty in Charleston society who traveled widely throughout the United States during the antebellum years, including to the American West and New Orleans.</para>

<para id="fs-idm236374688">In April 1840, Mary married the wealthy James Chesnut, Jr., a Princeton graduate, and the two settled at his family home, Mulberry, outside Camden, South Carolina. James was one of South Carolina‚Äôs most influential politicians and served as a U.S. senator in the 1850s, during the sectionalism crisis that led to the Civil War. In 1860, Mary Chesnut traveled to Florida to see her sister and was on the return journey when she heard of Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs election to the presidency. James Chesnut quickly resigned from the Senate and played an important role in drafting the South Carolina ordinance of secession. He was later part of the negotiating party sent to receive the surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor in April 1861, putting the family at the center of the secession crisis.</para>
<para id="fs-idm275267632">Mary Chesnut‚Äôs wartime diary has become a leading account of the elite white southern woman‚Äôs experience during the Civil War era. Noted southern historian Drew Gilpin Faust called Chesnut the ‚Äúmost ambitious among these would-be historian diarists.‚Äù While her husband worked for the war effort, Chesnut lived in Richmond, Virginia, during the summer of 1861 before moving back to South Carolina. During the final months of the war, she fled South Carolina and her home because of the invasion of Union General William Tecumseh Sherman‚Äôs army, which eventually devastated Columbia, South Carolina, near Camden. The experience of becoming a refugee in North Carolina stripped her of the finery and trappings of gentility she had enjoyed her entire life. While living with a wealthy woman from North Carolina, she found opportunity to both praise and criticize. ‚ÄúMine hostess is young &amp; handsome, very well educated, talks well, seems so ladylike &amp; kind,‚Äù but, Chesnut added, she ‚Äúlives amidst dirt in a way that would shame the poorest overseer‚Äôs wife‚Ä¶. A Lady evidently, she is manners &amp; taste! &amp; surroundings worthy a barbarian.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm253649856">With hundreds of thousands of white men away serving in the ranks of Confederate armies, southern women frequently experienced the collapse of the institution of slavery firsthand. Chesnut claimed not to have feared her slaves, but the murder of her cousin Betsey Witherspoon by her own slaves caused her and many of her neighbors to reconsider. Chesnut‚Äôs assessment of slavery focused on the social evils of the institution for white women, in that it gave white men virtually unfettered sexual access to black women.</para>
<para id="fs-idm238062272">The Civil War changed the nature of both leisure pursuits and work for plantation wives. Elite women of the South passed many hours reading during the war, though they often lamented the lack of reading material, partly a phenomenon of the South‚Äôs prewar dependence on periodicals from northern states and abroad. Chesnut borrowed Edward Creasy‚Äôs <emphasis effect="italics">Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</emphasis> from a library in Columbia, South Carolina, in early 1862 and read that historical work with an eye toward understanding the conflict occurring around her in the 1860s.</para>
<para id="fs-idm248055536">The war threw many white southern women into the public world of work in new ways. Chesnut deplored the idea of white women working as laborers and secretarial staff in the Confederate government‚Äôs burgeoning war machine. She was especially concerned about the freedom this gave younger women to interact with men unsupervised by other and older women.</para>
<para id="fs-idm271499120">Between November 1863 and early May 1864, Chesnut was again living in Richmond. She worked briefly at a Richmond hospital as a nurse, but she had to give up the work after fainting regularly because of what she saw. She spent time raising money and procuring medical supplies, only to feel pressure from other women to return to nursing work. When she did, it was only for half a day, feeding injured soldiers at a wayside hospital where patients had only minor injuries. She continued to object to the new social interactions between soldiers and unmarried women working in hospitals, primarily because of the soldiers‚Äô inappropriate flirting and advances. The difficult work of nursing reinforced her feeling of inadequacy and her inability to function in a world without her accustomed privilege and protected femininity. This led her to reassert the superiority of her elite, protected position and disdain the ‚ÄúFlorence Nightingale business.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm264226208">During the course of the war, Chesnut continued to support the political career of her husband (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_08_03_JChesnut"/>). Historian Douglas Southall Freeman argues that James Chesnut‚Äôs various posts in the Confederate Senate, as executive council on military affairs in South Carolina, and as an aide to Jefferson Davis, made him the <term><emphasis effect="italics">de facto</emphasis></term> liaison officer between South Carolina and the Davis administration. At one point, Mary Chesnut lived in a house directly across from the ‚ÄúWhite House‚Äù of the Confederacy in Richmond, becoming a confidant of the First Lady of the Confederacy, Varina Davis.</para>

<para id="fs-idm264223536">Ultimately, Mary Chesnut produced seven volumes of wartime records. After the war, she wrote three unpublished novels and revised her diaries of the war years. Eminent southern historian C. Vann Woodward received the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1982 for <emphasis effect="italics">Mary Chesnut‚Äôs Civil War</emphasis>, his edited version of her diary. Chesnut‚Äôs reflections on the Civil War are an invaluable resource to study the conflict from the perspective of a wealthy, politically connected Confederate woman.</para>
