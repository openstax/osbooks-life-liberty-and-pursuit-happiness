<para id="fs-idm405868736">During a cool October 1740 morning in Kensington, Connecticut, Nathan Cole was hard at work in his field, as he had been since sunrise. Suddenly his labor was interrupted by a passing messenger‚Äôs shouts: at 10 o‚Äôclock the evangelist George Whitefield was going to preach in nearby Middletown. Nathan immediately dropped his tools in the field, ran to fetch his wife, and saddled his horse. He and his wife joined a throng of others hurrying along the roads to Middletown, afraid they would arrive too late to hear the famous preacher.</para>
<para id="fs-idm404979920">After receiving his degree from Oxford University, Whitefield had begun a life of <term>itinerant</term> preaching and evangelism. Rather than expounding on the intricacies of Christian doctrine, he appealed to the emotions of his listeners at home in England, and now, still only twenty-five years old, he had brought his new style to the American colonies (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_02_03_Whitefield"/>). For weeks, Nathan Cole had heard reports that Whitefield‚Äôs preaching tour of the colonies was drawing huge crowds numbering in the tens of thousands. Many people in the audience experienced the ‚Äúnew birth‚Äù of evangelical conversion. Watching the celebrated preacher begin, Cole began to tremble. ‚ÄúMy hearing him preach,‚Äù he wrote in his diary, ‚Äúgave me a heart wound.‚Äù</para>

What details can you find each in image that indicate the artists‚Äô respective views of the preacher?</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm408242336">Whitefield‚Äôs message was simple: It was not enough to be baptized or go to church. Each individual must be converted by the Holy Spirit of God through a personal, wrenching examination of his or her own corruption and sinfulness. The youthful, twenty-five-year-old English minister held the crowd at Middletown spellbound with his masterful, emotional pleas that each person receive God‚Äôs gift of salvation and be ‚Äúborn again.‚Äù Countless listeners, including Nathan Cole, were converted.</para>
<para id="fs-idm415591312">Whitefield was not America‚Äôs first revival preacher. Just a few years earlier, Jonathan Edwards, a minister in Northampton, Massachusetts, had led a series of awakenings too. Possibly the greatest theologian the colonies had ever produced, Edwards was a master of rhetoric who preached on human sinfulness and the need for divine grace. Most famously, he delivered a 1741 sermon titled <emphasis effect="italics">Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</emphasis> (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_02_03_AngryGod"/>). Under Edwards‚Äô preaching, a town-wide revival broke out in Northampton from 1734 to 1735. In London, Edwards published a compelling account of this revival, <emphasis effect="italics">A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God</emphasis>. As George Whitefield, England‚Äôs John Wesley, and other evangelical ministers read Edwards‚Äô narrative, they realized they were part of a series of religious revivals that began in the colonies and spanned the Atlantic. They were in the middle of what historians came to call ‚ÄúThe Great Awakening.‚Äù</para>

<caption>This image shows the frontispiece of <emphasis effect="italics">Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, A Sermon Preached at Enfield, July 8, 1741,</emphasis> by Jonathan Edwards. Edwards was an evangelical preacher who led a Protestant revival in New England. This was his most famous sermon, the text of which was reprinted often and distributed widely.</caption>

<para id="fs-idm413357056">Over the course of his seven preaching tours of the colonies, Whitefield reached 75 to 80 percent of the population, sometimes addressing crowds that approached thirty thousand listeners. His revivals were controversial. Local ministers resented Whitefield and other traveling preachers coming to their towns uninvited. When revivalists drew massive crowds and preached in public, local ministers and churches worried the preachers were undermining their spiritual authority. Worse, some evangelical preachers, such as New Jersey‚Äôs Gilbert Tennent, dared to suggest that many of the established church‚Äôs pastors were not converted. Tennent charged that some pastors were Christians only in name, because they had not yet experienced the ‚Äúnew birth.‚Äù He called true believers to leave the lukewarm established congregations and join new, ‚Äúpure‚Äù churches.</para>
<para id="fs-idm417045856">In addition to challenging religious authorities, the revivals could also challenge social conventions. Following their conviction that all believers were equal before God, some evangelicals allowed women to ‚Äúexhort,‚Äù or preach informally, during meetings. In Ipswich, Massachusetts, a gathering of evangelicals in 1742 was amazed when a ‚Äúspirit of prophecy‚Äù filled a female convert named Lucy Smith. Smith preached the Gospel to this assembly for over two hours. White evangelicals even ordained converted African Americans and American Indians to preach or be missionaries, although typically only to their own communities. Some evangelicals began to argue that, in light of the Gospel‚Äôs implications, slave owning was sinful. These egalitarian impulses were unprecedented in colonial society and challenged racial and social hierarchies, especially in the South.</para>
<para id="fs-idm414790848">Evangelical teaching also challenged barriers based on social class. Uneducated, poor whites with no theological training often felt a strong calling to preach. Their sermons were frequently highly charged, even frenzied, displays of emotion and, according to some critics, resulted in indecent and immoral behavior. However, the messages of these radical preachers resonated with those lower on the social ladder. Common people and American Indians loved the emotional, radical preaching of James Davenport, a college-educated preacher in New England. In 1743, in New London, Connecticut, Davenport and his followers built a bonfire and instructed the audience to throw their religious books into it. Davenport then turned his eye to their fancy clothing (‚Äúcambric caps, red-heeled sho[e]s, fans, necklaces, gloves‚Äù), all of which deserved to be burned. Davenport led by example, pulling off his own pants and throwing them on the fire. But this action went too far for some audience members. A woman snatched his clothes off the flames and threw them in his face, and his audience rebuked him.</para>
<para id="fs-idm408935056">Many critics thought the emotional appeal of the ‚ÄúNew Light‚Äù evangelical ministers was foolish and led to social chaos. The New Light ministers rejected the rationalism of the Enlightenment and appealed to the passions of the audience members rather than their reason, which resulted in emotional reaction and immediate conversion. The main source of opposition was conservative pastors of the established churches, particularly Anglicans and Congregationalists. These ‚ÄúOld Light‚Äù ministers insisted upon sober and rational sermons and religious practices and rejected the passionate New Light theology and style of the evangelical preachers. The Old Light ministers successfully banned the New Light ministers from preaching in several churches and towns.</para>
<para id="fs-idm416150352">By the late 1740s, the New England revivals had cooled, but the Great Awakening‚Äôs effects were widespread and long-lasting as the fervor continued to spread to the southern colonies in the ensuing decades. The revivals had weakened the hold of the established churches in colonial America, and large numbers of Christians joined new evangelical churches like those of the Baptists or Methodists.</para>
<para id="fs-idm413584704">The Great Awakening also contributed to colonial religious liberty by changing the balance of religious power. During the American Revolution and the struggle for individual liberty, Baptists used their new numbers and influence to challenge religious establishments, first in Virginia and then throughout the new nation. Many evangelicals called for an end to government-supported denominations, which received tax money and lands called ‚Äúglebes‚Äù to support ministers and churches. After the Revolution, opposition to established churches helped inspire the First Amendment‚Äôs prohibition of the ‚Äúestablishment of religion‚Äù and its guarantee of ‚Äúfree exercise‚Äù of religion. The founders believed that freedom of conscience was an inalienable right of all individuals. The religious landscape of the new nation was never the same.</para>
<para id="fs-idm416823760">The Great Awakening helped prepare the colonies for the American Revolution. Its ethos strengthened the appeal of the ideals of liberty, and its ministers and the members of the new evangelical faiths strongly supported the Revolution. The drive for religious liberty against a tyrannical religious authority fed into the movement for civil liberty against the unjust political authority of the British in the 1770s. Likewise, the evangelical teaching that each individual believer was equal before God made it easier for people to accept the radical implications of democracy and to question authority. Thus, the same movement that sent Nathan Cole sprinting out of his field that October morning helped set the stage for American independence. The Great Awakening was the most significant religious and cultural upheaval in colonial American history, and helped forge U.S. civil and religious liberties emerging in the mid-eighteenth century.</para>
