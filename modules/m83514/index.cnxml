<para id="fs-idm255648640">Major General William Tecumseh Sherman‚Äôs actions after the capture of Atlanta and his subsequent March to the Sea are sometimes seen as anticipating the pattern of <term>total war</term> in the twentieth century. Some have claimed that Sherman was a war criminal, authorizing plunder and looting of civilian property. But the matter is more complex than either of these charges indicate. In fact, Sherman‚Äôs actions were the culmination of a Union policy toward civilians that evolved during the course of the war.</para>
<para id="fs-idm279197600">Initially, the Union adhered to a policy of ‚Äú<term>conciliation</term>,‚Äù waging a somewhat limited war based on the notion that the majority of individuals in the seceded states did not support the breakup of the Union and that the governments of these states were illegal and did not represent their people‚Äôs will. Thus, early in the Rebellion, Union generals ordered their soldiers to respect the private property, including slaves, of all civilians, even those who were actively working against them. Even such generals as Ulysses Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman, who later advocated ‚Äúhard war,‚Äù adhered to the policy of conciliation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm257516720">Conciliation seemed to be working until George McClellan‚Äôs stalemate on the Virginia peninsula in the early summer of 1862 and the emergence of Robert E. Lee, whose subsequent victories substantially strengthened the rebellion. As a result, Union generals such as Henry Halleck in Missouri and Benjamin Butler in New Orleans began to use what historians have called ‚Äú<term>pragmatic</term>‚Äù policies, treating Unionists and those who were neutral better than they treated those who opposed the Union. The prominence of <term>guerrilla warfare</term> in Missouri and Tennessee meant that pragmatic policies took hold more quickly in the West than in Virginia (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_08_03_Ferguson"/>).</para>

<caption>Champ Ferguson, pictured here in an 1850s photograph, was a Southern guerrilla fighter. He and his company of men attacked civilians who held Union sympathies in Tennessee during the war. Upon his capture, Ferguson was executed for alleged war crimes.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm277307968">By 1863, pragmatism began to give way to ‚Äúhard war,‚Äù according to which Southerners who were identified as secessionists were the target of ‚Äúdirected severity,‚Äù a policy characterized by destruction of public property but also by a general unwillingness to harm civilians. Like pragmatism, hard war gained traction earlier in the West than it did in the East.</para>
<para id="fs-idm237770896">A milestone of sorts was reached in early 1863 when General Halleck published General Order 100, which provided ‚Äúa generalized set of regulations‚Äù regarding the legal aspects of conducting war. The document, signed by President Lincoln in April 1863, authorized hard war but placed clear limits on its conduct.</para>
<para id="fs-idm232904656">The Vicksburg Campaign signaled the beginning of the Union‚Äôs hard war policy, permitting whatever was necessary‚Äîincluding the destruction of civilian property‚Äîto bring the conflict to an end. During the Vicksburg Campaign, Grant lived off the land for a time, allowing his army to take what it needed from civilians in its path. Approximately seven months after the fall of Vicksburg, Sherman applied the ‚Äúhard hand of war‚Äù against central Mississippi during the Meridian operation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm257479904">This operation was different in that, for the first time, Sherman instructed Union troops to wage a war of destruction, leaving civilians with enough for survival but not enough to support military activity. The Meridian operation, which provided a blueprint for Sherman‚Äôs March to the Sea, was also an example of psychological warfare, meant to destroy any hope the people might have had of a Confederate victory.</para>
<para id="fs-idm237435408">In September 1863, Sherman (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_08_03_Sherman"/>) laid out his emerging philosophy in a long letter to Halleck. He wrote that ‚Äúevery member of the nation is bound by natural and constitutional law to ‚Äômaintain and defend the Government against all its opposers whomsoever.‚Äô If they fail to do it they are derelict,‚Äù he maintained, ‚Äúand can be punished or deprived of all advantages arising from the labors of those who do.‚Äù Sherman came to Georgia to command an army in that theater and put this policy into operation after the fall of Atlanta during his famous March to the Sea.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm218142000">After capturing Atlanta, Sherman ordered the occupants to evacuate the city. He justified his reasons for taking this step in a September 1864 letter to Halleck, who remained chief of staff after Grant replaced him as general in chief in March 1864.</para>
<quote id="fs-idm275306448">It is sufficient for my Government to know that the removal of the inhabitants has been made with liberality and fairness; that it has been attended by no force, and that no women or children have suffered, unless for want of provisions by their natural protectors and friends. My real reasons for this step were, we want all the houses of Atlanta for military storage and occupation. We want to contract the lines of defenses so as to diminish the garrison to the limit necessary to defend its narrow and vital parts instead of embracing, as the lines now do, the vast suburbs. This contraction of the lines, with the necessary citadels and <term>redoubts</term>, will make it necessary to destroy the very houses used by families as residences. Atlanta is a fortified town, was stubbornly defended and fairly captured. As captors we have a right to it. The residence here of a poor population would compel us sooner or later to feed them or see them starve under our eyes. The residence here of the families of our enemies would be a temptation and a means to keep up a correspondence dangerous and hurtful to our cause.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm236052240">Sherman‚Äôs correspondence with Halleck also included the letters he exchanged with the Confederate commander General John Bell Hood. Sherman wrote:</para>
<quote id="fs-idm252113888">You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it; and those who brought war into our country deserve all the curses and <term>maledictions</term> a people can pour out. I know I had no hand in making this war, and I know I will make more sacrifices to-day than any of you to secure peace. But you cannot have peace and a division of our country. If the United States submits to a division now, it will not stop, but will go on until we reap the fate of Mexico, which is eternal war. The United States does and must assert its authority, wherever it once had power; for, if it relaxes one bit to pressure, it is gone, and I believe that such is the national feeling.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm275339520">After the fall of Atlanta, Sherman asked for and received permission from Grant to march to Savannah. On this march, Sherman deployed 62,000 troops in two wings. He departed Atlanta on November 15 and, for the next month, he cut a swath of destruction 60 miles wide from Atlanta to Savannah, systematically destroying anything that could benefit the Rebel military effort (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_08_03_DstryRail"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm247914368">Sherman‚Äôs goal was to ‚Äúmake Georgia howl.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are not only fighting hostile armies, but a hostile people, and we must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war.‚Äù The hard war was here for Georgia. ‚ÄúWe cannot change the hearts and minds of those people of the South, but we can make war so terrible . . . [and] make them so sick of war that generations would pass away before they would again appeal to it.‚Äù Sherman contended that the United States and its representatives had the right to ‚Äúremove and destroy every obstacle‚Äîif need be, take every life, every acre of land, every particle of property, everything that to us seems proper‚Ä¶[and] that all who do not aid are enemies, and we will not account to them for our acts.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm230826480">Some still believe Sherman‚Äôs army burned every home in its path. In fact, although the men destroyed public buildings, they largely left individual homes intact. But the myth of terrible destruction, rather than the truth of directed severity, has persisted.</para>
<para id="fs-idm270368880">The March to the Sea was meant to demonstrate to Southern civilians that ‚Äúthey could be hurt‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe Confederate government was powerless to protect them.‚Äù It was also meant as a policy to end the horrific Civil War, which had killed more than 600,000 soldiers.</para>
