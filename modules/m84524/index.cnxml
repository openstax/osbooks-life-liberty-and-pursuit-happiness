<para id="fs-idm912016144">On June 6, 1966, one day into his solitary ‚ÄúMarch Against Fear,‚Äù James Meredith was shot and wounded by a sniper in northwest Mississippi. Meredith, an Air Force veteran and the first African American to attend the University of Mississippi, had planned to march from Memphis to Jackson to encourage voter registration by black citizens. As he recovered, prominent black leaders promised Meredith they would continue his march. Among them was Stokely Carmichael, the newly elected chair of SNCC, who aimed to steer the broader movement in a more militant direction. As the march carried on, Carmichael led a crowd at a June 16 rally in Greenwood, Mississippi, in a chant: ‚ÄúWe want Black power!‚Äù Martin Luther King Jr. had objected, but with that outcry, a new faction of the black freedom movement was born.</para>
<para id="fs-idm869243328">Carmichael‚Äôs speech gave the faction a name and a new impetus for its organizational development, but he was neither Black Power‚Äôs true founder nor its most important formative influence. The crucial figure in the radicalizing of black political thought in this period was Malcolm X, whom Carmichael regarded as his ‚Äúpatron saint.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm900622720">Malcolm X, originally Malcolm Little, was born May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_14_03_Malcolm"/>). His father, Earl, and mother, Louise, were followers of the Jamaican-born black nationalist Marcus Garvey. After Earl Little‚Äôs death in 1931 in disputed circumstances, an overburdened Louise descended into chronic mental illness. In his teens, Malcolm X lapsed into a life of criminality, landing in prison for grand larceny before he reached the age of 20 years. His imprisonment proved to be the great turning point in his life.</para>

<para id="fs-idm218460880">In prison, Malcolm X met an older inmate named John Elton Bembry, a man of broad knowledge and intellectual curiosity, who inspired him to embark on a rigorous course of self-education. Meanwhile, at the behest of siblings, Malcolm X joined the <term>Nation of Islam</term>. After his release from prison in 1952, he became an assistant minister at the Nation of Islam‚Äôs Temple No. 1 in Detroit. During the next few years, he established thriving temples in Boston and Philadelphia and finally took a position as the minister of Temple No. 7 in Harlem.</para>
<para id="fs-idm780985456">In July 1959, a New York television station aired a documentary series on the Nation of Islam entitled ‚ÄúThe Hate that Hate Produced.‚Äù Many Americans found it shocking, but shortly after the series aired, membership increased dramatically, and Malcolm X became a nationally known figure.</para>
<para id="fs-idm227147472">The message he preached was contrary to the mainstream civil rights movement‚Äôs dedication to nonviolence and integration. It advocated defensive, not aggressive, violence, but Malcolm X‚Äôs rhetoric nonetheless generated fears that it would incite violence. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a turn-the-other-cheek revolution,‚Äù he told a Detroit audience in 1963. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such <emphasis effect="italics">thing</emphasis> as a nonviolent revolution,‚Äù he insisted. ‚ÄúA revolution is bloody.‚Ä¶ Revolution overturns and destroys everything that gets in its way.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúOur religion teaches us to be intelligent. Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery. That‚Äôs a good religion.‚Äù The following year, he warned of the consequences of continuing failure to enact reforms: ‚ÄúIn 1964, it‚Äôs the ballot or the bullet.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm194519488">Malcolm X opposed racial integration and derided ‚Äúthe Negro revolution‚Äù as the ‚Äúonly revolution in which the goal is a desegregated lunch counter, a desegregated theater‚Ä¶and a desegregated public toilet.‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs no revolution.‚Äù The ‚Äúphilosophy of black nationalism,‚Äù he explained, ‚Äúmeans that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community,‚Äù along with the economy. ‚ÄúWhy should white people be running all the stores in our community?‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm900023424">Eventually, Malcolm X wanted to focus more on black understanding of cultural ties to Africa and leadership within black communities. When he broke with the Nation of Islam for moral and political reasons, he made himself a marked man. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated by Nation of Islam loyalists while he attempted to lecture in Harlem.</para>
<para id="fs-idm209897424">Malcolm X‚Äôs linking of black self-respect with defensive violence and his calls for political and economic power independent of whites were powerfully appealing to many black residents of northern urban ghettos who were angered by violence committed against the southern civil rights movement and dissatisfied with the limited benefits of its desegregation agenda. His agenda held a similar appeal for younger, increasingly militant factions of the southern movement as it progressed through its climactic campaigns. Carmichael contended that after the violence in Birmingham and Selma, African Americans could no longer be animated by integrationist love. His Black Power call was endorsed by SNCC and the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE), and the schism in the freedom movement became irreparable.</para>
<para id="fs-idm786316656">In his <term>manifesto</term>, <emphasis effect="italics">Black Power: The Politics of Liberation in America</emphasis>, Carmichael maintained, despite his objections to integration as a trick to achieve white supremacy, that the moral center of Black Power was neither anti-white nor pro-violence (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_14_03_SCarmichae"/>). Even so, mainstream leaders‚Äô concerns about divisiveness, incitement to violence, and white backlash were legitimate. The call for Black Power came amid an outbreak of race-related urban rioting that began in 1964 and spread to hundreds of U.S. cities over the next few years. The double-edged character of Black Power‚Äîdefended as a program of peaceful self-affirmation and self-empowerment but marred at its extremes by a romanticizing of revolutionary violence‚Äîwas most vividly exemplified by the career of its most controversial product, the <term>Black Panther Party</term>.</para>

<para id="fs-idm911593344">As the Black Power idea gained support, Black Panther parties and organizations formed across the country (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_14_03_SealeNewt"/>). The most influential and longest lasting was the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, formed in Oakland, California, in October 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, both of whom were inspired by the lectures of Malcolm X. Two events the next year brought national notoriety to the newly founded party. In May 1967, 30 Panthers, 20 of whom bore arms in open display, demonstrated at the state capitol in Sacramento to protest a bill designed to prevent party members from conducting armed patrols to deter police misconduct. The bill passed, likely due, in part, to the demonstration. Then, in October, Newton was involved in a traffic altercation with police that left an officer dead and resulted in a manslaughter conviction for Newton. The conviction was overturned in 1970 due to an error by the judge, but in the meantime, Newton‚Äôs imprisonment had made him a political martyr in the eyes of sympathizers. An ensuing ‚ÄúFree Huey‚Äù campaign proved a great boon for the party‚Äôs fundraising.</para>

<para id="fs-idm870387376">After Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs assassination in April 1968, membership in Black Panther Party chapters nationwide increased substantially. Supporters admired the party‚Äôs boldness in opposing police brutality, along with its efforts to improve conditions in urban ghettos by operating schools, health-care clinics, and free-breakfast programs. Critics, however, pointed to a record of criminality, including murders, beatings, intimidation of witnesses, extortion, and mismanagement of funds that, in the end, alienated its donors and left the party resembling a glorified street gang. It finally disbanded in 1982. Newton was killed in a drug dispute in 1989.</para>
<para id="fs-idm221590848">A similar fate had already befallen SNCC. By early 1967, the organization was virtually bankrupt. Carmichael was succeeded as leader by the even more militant H. Rap Brown, who was indicted the next year for incitement to violence. SNCC disintegrated shortly thereafter.</para>
<para id="fs-idm895405200">Black Power activism left a divided legacy. Some link its rise to the decline of the black freedom movement, because the upsurge in urban violence and the movement‚Äôs factious and illiberal (nationalist and socialist) offshoots alienated mainstream America. The heyday of Black Power activism was over by the mid-1970s, and some of the major problems it addressed‚Äîthe poverty and social disorder plaguing urban ghettos‚Äîhave persisted to the present day. In other respects, however, the Black Power movement‚Äôs enduring, transformative influence over America‚Äôs political institutions and culture is undeniable. Black voters, frequently acting as a bloc, have wielded substantial political power in the elections of numerous African American candidates, including mayors, congressional members, and of course, the first African American U.S. president.</para>
<para id="fs-idm907947472">The influence of Black Power on education has been perhaps even more pronounced, as evident foremost in the rise of multicultural education, with its emphasis on the affirmation of racial and ethnic diversity and its discrediting of the traditional ‚Äúmelting pot‚Äù model of integration. Finally, Black Power activists‚Äô allegations of racially charged police misconduct have been recently reprised by the Black Lives Matter movement, whose statement of ‚ÄúDemands‚Äù shows the heavy influence of the Black Panther Party‚Äôs 10-point ‚ÄúPlatform and Program.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm894890224">As to whether the Black Power movement, on balance, has been a positive or a negative force in American political life, opinions remain divided. It is safe to say that so long as social and economic disparities persist between African Americans and the general American population, the movement‚Äôs appeal in one form or another will endure.</para>
