<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (5 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm231682096">Project the first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence on the board or read aloud to students, as best fits your classroom.</para>
<quote id="fs-idm228643408">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm222186832">Ask students to consider whose voice was not a part of this message. Did the Declaration or U.S. Founding documents leave instructions for how such omissions could be fixed?</para>

<item>Sort students into pairs or small groups and tell them they will be comparing the Declaration of Independence with the Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions using <emphasis effect="bold">Handout B: Comparing Declarations Student Worksheet</emphasis>.

<item>Explain the instructions for Handout B and clarify as needed for any questions. Depending on student background and skill, you might want to do a think-aloud for one item from 1‚Äì5 (Introduction and Preamble; finding differences) and one item from the Grievances section (items 6‚Äì11; explaining similarities) as examples.</item>
<item>After students have completed Handout B, reconvene the whole class and have groups share their responses for discussion of the comparisons. Discuss: Why do you think Stanton chose to model the Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions after the Declaration of Independence? What do you think Stanton meant by noting that depriving women of legal rights left them ‚Äúmorally irresponsible‚Äù? What is the connection between liberty and responsibility? Citizenship and liberty?</item>
