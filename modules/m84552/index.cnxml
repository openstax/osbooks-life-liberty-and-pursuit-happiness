<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm497730880">Students will read the excerpt from the opening of the Declaration of Independence and answer some questions to analyze what the document says is the duty of people in the face of a violation of natural rights. After allowing time for the students to read the document and brainstorm responses with a partner, the teacher will lead a discussion. The discussion should allow students to share their interpretations.</para>

<title>II. Exploration (40 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm195868112">In pairs, students will read two primary source documents, in Handouts B and C. Each student will read and analyze one of the documents. The students will then take turns sharing what they have learned about the document with each other. After the presentation, each student will then read the second document to see if they agree with the conclusions their partner has reached. In this stage, the teacher should move about the classroom to confirm that students are analyzing the documents correctly. This observation and questioning will serve as formative assessments for the lesson.</para>
