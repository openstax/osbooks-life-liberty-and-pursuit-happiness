<para id="fs-idm381626336">On January 15, 1937, five days before his second inauguration, President Franklin Roosevelt wrote to Harvard law professor Felix Frankfurter: ‚ÄúVery confidentially, I may give you an awful shock in about two weeks. Even if you do not agree, suspend judgment and I will tell you the story.‚Äù Shock, indeed. On February 5, while meeting with leaders of Congress and his cabinet at the White House, Roosevelt unveiled his proposal to revamp the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court of the United States.</para>
<para id="fs-idm515458672">Officially titled the Judicial Procedures Reform Act, the plan would allow the president to nominate an additional judge to the Court for every sitting judge who had served at least 10 years, had reached the age of 70 years, and did not step down within six months. If approved by Congress, the legislation would have given the president up to six new appointments to the Supreme Court. To the Congressional leaders who mostly sat and listened in stunned silence, Roosevelt explained that the legislation had become necessary because the aging justices on Charles Evans Hughes‚Äôs court could not keep up with their daunting caseload. As proof, he noted they had refused in the recent term to hear 90 percent of the petitions presented to them for review. Some justices, he concluded, ‚Äúare often unable to perceive their own infirmities.‚Äù (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_12_03_OTwist"/>)</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm333661040">The president‚Äôs initial rationale displayed ignorance of the Court‚Äôs procedures and offered ammunition to his soon-swelling crowd of critics. His critics thought Roosevelt was acting deceptively by not admitting his political motivation of having the Court endorse the constitutionality of New Deal programs. The Court‚Äôs oldest member, Justice Louis Brandeis, was 80 years old and had often voted to support New Deal legislation; so, too, had the chief justice, then age 75 years. Since the 1920s, moreover, Congress had given the justices complete discretion to manage their docket. Quickly realizing his gaffe, Roosevelt adopted a new argument for the proposed legislation in a radio fireside chat, in which he framed the issue as a struggle between popular government and a nonelected judicial oligarchy bent on preventing needed social and economic reforms to cure the nation‚Äôs festering economic problems. ‚ÄúWe cannot yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgment of a few men who, fearful of the future, would deny us the necessary means of dealing with the present,‚Äù he said.</para>
<para id="fs-idm347733952">But the damage had been done. Soon denounced as Roosevelt‚Äôs ‚ÄúCourt-packing plan,‚Äù the proposal drew opposition not only from Republicans but also from key Democratic leaders, including the chairs of both House and Senate judiciary committees. And in early March, Chief Justice Hughes, with the approval of both liberal Justice Louis Brandeis and conservative Justice Willis Van Devanter, sent a letter to the latter body demolishing the president‚Äôs arguments about the slow pace of the Court‚Äôs decision-making. Not only were his colleagues abreast of their decisions, Hughes affirmed, but also adding additional justices would only lengthen discussions and delay the resolution of cases.</para>
<para id="fs-idm352826784">By January 1937, Roosevelt had ample reasons to be angry at the chief justice and his eight colleagues, who, since 1934, had often held key New Deal legislation such as the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act to be unconstitutional. However, the president feared the same judicial vetoes would kill pending New Deal legislation in 1937, including the National Labor Relations Act, which was intended to secure collective bargaining rights for the fledging labor unions in mass-production industries.</para>
<para id="fs-idm528771168">Roosevelt had chosen a simple, statutory route to change his luck in the Court, but his method had embittered his own legislative leaders with its secrecy, and by his failure to consult the best legal minds available to him. He had rejected a constitutional amendment as too cumbersome and time consuming, but he had avoided a simple revision of the federal judicial pension rules that might have effectively hastened several retirements by the Court‚Äôs septuagenarians. Nor had Roosevelt anticipated that the Court would have to give a constitutional green light to state-sponsored reforms and to his own 1937 agenda. But beginning in March, Hughes and his colleagues controlled the fate of these measures, and ultimately the fate of the President‚Äôs Judicial Procedures Reform Act, as well (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_12_03_HughesCourt"/>).</para>

<caption>The Hughes Court, pictured with members from 1932‚Äì1937, had a record of declaring New Deal legislation unconstitutional.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm388455680">Although its chances of success were lower than 50-50 from the beginning, the president‚Äôs plan confronted Hughes with a serious external threat to judicial independence and the separation of powers. Hughes, always concerned with the safety of his Court, knew this challenge had been provoked in part by the Court‚Äôs inability to resolve critical contradictions in its own constitutional precedents, some stretching back to the late nineteenth century. Unless these could be resolved, the Court faced more confrontations with Congress, state legislatures, and, ultimately, the American people, which had just given Roosevelt one of the largest elector victories in history.</para>
<para id="fs-idm393681440">The Court‚Äôs contradictory precedents possibly originated in the oldest issue in the nation‚Äôs constitutional history: federalism, the constitutional balance of powers between national and state authority; and the ability to cope with the myriad problems facing the American people in the grip of the worst economic crisis in their history. Federalism manifested itself in three areas of sharp constitutional dispute: first, the Article I powers given to Congress to tax the American people; second, Congress‚Äôs power ‚Äúto regulate commerce among the states;‚Äù and third, the command of the Fourteenth Amendment that ‚Äúno state shall deprive a person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.‚Äù The chief justice managed a very fractured Court on these contentious constitutional interpretations.</para>
<para id="fs-idm346181744">Four conservative justices‚ÄîWillis Van Devanter, George Sutherland, James McReynolds, and Pierce Butler‚Äîregarded the Constitution as basically a charter of limitations on both federal and state power, especially in areas touching the rights of property and contract. They flatly rejected government efforts aimed at redistributing economic rewards. Three liberal justices‚ÄîLouis Brandeis, Harlan Stone, and Benjamin Cardozo‚Äîtended to view the Constitution as endowing government with this authority (and therefore allowing these efforts to cope with the economic crisis). Hughes and his younger colleague, Owen Roberts, therefore held the balance of power, with the chief justice often joining the three liberals and Roberts the four conservatives.</para>
<para id="fs-idm392859024">The Court had stood united when striking down poorly conceived efforts by the administration to regulate the economy in 1935‚Äîa farm mortgage relief law, the National Recovery Act, and Roosevelt‚Äôs removal of a member of the Federal Trade Commission. But Justice Roberts soon infuriated Roosevelt‚Äôs supporters when he joined the four conservative judges in overturning three federal laws and one state statute‚Äîthe Railroad Retirement Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act, and a New York minimum-wage provision. Roberts ruled that railroad pensions, agricultural production, and coal mining all remained beyond Congress‚Äôs power to regulate ‚Äúcommerce among the states.‚Äù Roberts‚Äô vote also killed the New York minimum-wage law for women on the grounds that it infringed ‚Äúliberty of contract protected by the Due Process Clause,‚Äù although, a year earlier, he had upheld the state‚Äôs authority to fix minimum prices for milk. Hughes dissented in part in all these decisions. Justice Stone denounced Roberts‚Äôs majority opinion in the Agricultural Adjustment case as ‚Äúa tortured construction of the Constitution.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm344102576">Shortly after Roosevelt announced the court-packing plan, the Court surprised the country by upholding a new minimum-wage law from Washington state, one almost identical to the New York measure overturned six months earlier. Roberts now voted with Hughes and the three liberals, which soon gave rise to the idea that Roosevelt‚Äôs plan had motivated his about-face. Then, in the second week of April, the same majority sustained Congress‚Äôs authority to require collective bargaining for all companies whose labor relations remained an integral part of ‚Äúcommerce among the states.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm380615488">In late May, soon after Justice Van Devanter announced his intention to retire, the new Hughes-Roberts majority also upheld the Social Security Act. Hughes‚Äôs Court had secured Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal. Had Roosevelt‚Äôs proposal forced the justices, especially Roberts, to change their constitutional minds, making ‚Äúa switch in time that saved nine,‚Äù according to one observer in 1937? A close look at the evidence suggests otherwise. Roberts had voted to uphold the second minimum-wage law in December 1936, long before Roosevelt revealed his plan, though the announcement of the decision had been delayed until March, due to Justice Stone‚Äôs illness. And the facts of the National Labor Relations Board case presented Hughes and the Court with indisputable evidence that labor-management conflict disrupted and endangered ‚Äúcommerce among the states.‚Äù Roosevelt‚Äôs massive reelection victory in November 1936 may have swayed some opinion on the Court, but that remains pure speculation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm339570400">Despite advice from Congressional leaders, Roosevelt persisted in forcing a vote on his plan even after Van Devanter‚Äôs announcement and the Social Security decision. The Senate finally ended the suspense by voting 70‚Äì20 to send the measure back to committee in July, where it quietly died. The fallout from the battle left many casualties. Roosevelt‚Äôs foes in both parties had been energized by his defeat. An economic recession in 1937‚Äì1938 further tarnished his stature; only a single new reform measure passed Congress before 1940. Roosevelt appointed eight justices to the Supreme Court before his death in 1945, but Hughes had outmaneuvered him and saved the Court to fight another day.</para>
