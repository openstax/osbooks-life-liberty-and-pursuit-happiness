<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm599480144">Once the “space race” began between the United States and the Soviet Union, people became fascinated with the idea of traveling to outer space. Many young people in the 1960s and 1970s wanted to be astronauts when they grew up. For years, the world watched live as rockets from the Soviet Union and the United States took flight. By the 1980s, space travel seemed almost effortless and the early failures of the space program were easily forgotten. However, in January 1986, the space shuttle <emphasis effect="italics">Challenger</emphasis> exploded right after liftoff, killing all seven crew members. The <emphasis effect="italics">Challenger</emphasis> disaster was unique in several ways. It had been years since the United States had suffered a major setback in the space race. In addition, a public school teacher was on the shuttle, and many children across the country watched the explosion occur live on TV in their classrooms. Later that day, President Reagan postponed his State of the Union address and instead gave a short speech to the nation to commemorate the loss of the astronauts.</para>

But we’ve never lost an astronaut in flight; we’ve never had a tragedy like this</link>. And perhaps we’ve forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle; but they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we’re thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, “Give me a challenge and I’ll meet it with joy.” They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.</entry>

We’ve grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we’ve only just begun. We’re still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers</link>.</entry>

I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It’s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It’s all part of taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the <emphasis effect="bold">fainthearted</emphasis>; it belongs to the brave.

On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, “He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.” Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake’s, complete.</link></entry>
