<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm465564128">The late nineteenth century experienced one of the largest mass migrations in history. Millions of immigrants came to the United States from other parts of North America, as well as from Europe and Asia. Immigrants, who settled in the United States primarily for the economic opportunity afforded by industrialization, faced many challenges upon arriving. The influx of so many immigrants changed American culture and presented unique tensions in American society. This led to a debate among native citizens over immigration, citizenship, and the restriction of immigration. Immigrants arriving during the Gilded Age included large numbers of eastern Europeans and Asians. Cartoons from the period reflect differing perspectives on the new wave of immigrants. Some welcomed these men and women as a new source of cheap labor; others viewed these newcomers with suspicion. Look carefully at the images before answering the questions. It may be helpful to zoom in on the cartoons to study the detail in each.</para>

<media id="fs-idm322738880" alt="In the foreground are the stereotyped caricatures carrying their blocks to add to the wall. In the background, across a body of water, the Chinese have torn a hole in their wall and a boat full of Americans is headed toward the hole to enter China. The caption at the bottom of the cartoon reads “The Anti-Chinese wall—The American wall goes up as the Chinese original goes down.”">

<caption>The caption reads: “The Anti-Chinese wall—The American wall goes up as the Chinese original goes down.” This cartoon shows stereotypes of laborers who include Irishmen, an African American, a Civil War veteran, an Italian, a Frenchman, and a Jew, all building a wall against the Chinese. The mortar used to mount the blocks is labeled “congressional mortar.” The blocks carried by each laborer are labeled prejudice, nonreciprocity, law against race, fear, and so forth. Across the sea, a ship flying the American flag enters China, as the Chinese knock down their own wall and permit trade with the United States.</caption>

<figure id="BRI_APUSH_09_06_Immig2" class="full-width">
<media id="fs-idm476595216" alt="The cartoon shows a woman, Columbia, wearing an American flag. She is stirring a large bowl, labeled Citizenship, with a spoon that is labeled Equal Rights. In the bowl, there are many people representing different nationalities. An Irishman stands on the edge of the pot opposite the woman. He is holding a knife in one hand and a flag in the other. The caption at the bottom reads “The mortar of assimilation—and the one element that won’t mix.”">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/BRI_APUSH_09_06_Immig2.jpg"/>
</media>
<caption>The man standing at the edge of the bowl holds a knife and flag that reads “Clan na Gael.” Clan na Gael was an organization that desired Irish independence and used violence to fight British oppression. Until the formal establishment of the Irish free state in 1922, Ireland was controlled by the British empire.</caption>
