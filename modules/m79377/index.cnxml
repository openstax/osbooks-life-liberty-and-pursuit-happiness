<para id="fs-idm178135360">Before reading this source, students should be familiar with the societal, cultural, and economic conditions of eighteenth century and nineteenth century American life that sustained the institution of slavery. Students should avoid presentism when interpreting this source and approach it in the context of the growing entrenchment of slavery into the southern way of life in the antebellum era.

<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm162328064">As abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison grew louder in their attacks on slavery and southern culture, several white southerners produced a new defense of slavery. This defense was not only a response to the growing abolitionist movement but also to Nat Turner’s Rebellion (which terrified southern whites) and the expansion of the lucrative cotton economy into the Deep South. In this speech, John C. Calhoun, then a U.S. senator, vigorously defended the institution of slavery and stated the essence of this new intellectual defense of the institution: Southerners must stop apologizing for slavery and reject the idea that it was a necessary evil. Instead, Calhoun insisted, slavery was a “positive good.” He went further, making legal arguments about the Constitution protecting states’ rights to preserve slavery. Calhoun then offered a moral defense of slavery by claiming it to be a more humane method of organizing labor than the conditions wage laborers faced in industrial cities in Europe and the northern United States.</para>

Mine is the opposite creed, which teaches that <emphasis effect="bold">encroachments</emphasis> must be met at the beginning, and that those who act on the opposite principle are prepared to become slaves. In this case, in particular I hold concession or compromise to be fatal. <link target-id="fs-idm163914896">If we concede an inch</link>, concession would follow concession–compromise would follow compromise, until our ranks would be so broken that effectual resistance would be impossible. <link target-id="fs-idm177046896">We must meet the enemy on the frontier, with a fixed determination of maintaining our position at every hazard</link>. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">. . . I then predicted that the doctrine of the proclamation and the <emphasis effect="bold">Force Bill</emphasis>—that this Government had a right, in the last resort, to determine the extent of its own powers, and enforce its decision at the point of the <emphasis effect="bold">bayonet</emphasis> . . . would at no distant day arouse the dormant spirit of abolitionism. <link target-id="fs-idm205300544">I told him that the doctrine was tantamount to the assumption of unlimited power on the part of the Government, and that such would be the impression on the public mind in a large portion of the Union</link>.</entry>

<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">The consequence would be inevitable. A large portion of the Northern States believed slavery to be a sin, and would consider it as an obligation of conscience to abolish it if they should feel themselves in any degree responsible for its continuance. . . . <link target-id="fs-idm267624576">I then predicted that it would commence as it has with this fanatical portion of society, and that they would begin their operations on the ignorant, the weak, the young, and the thoughtless –and gradually extend upwards till they would become strong enough to obtain political control</link> . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">. . . By the necessary course of events, if left to themselves, we must become, finally, two people. It is impossible under the deadly hatred which must spring up between the two great nations, if the present causes are permitted to operate unchecked, that we should continue under the same political system. The conflicting elements would burst the Union asunder, powerful as are the links which hold it together. Abolition and the Union cannot coexist. As the friend of the Union I openly proclaim it–and the sooner it is known the better. . . . We of the South will not, cannot, surrender our institutions. <link target-id="fs-idm225489920">To maintain the existing relations between the two races, inhabiting that section of the Union, is indispensable to the peace and happiness of both</link>. It cannot be subverted without drenching the country in blood . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">. . . Be it good or bad, [slavery] has grown up with our society and institutions, and is so interwoven with them that to destroy it would be to destroy us as a people. But let me not be understood as admitting, even by implication, that the existing relations between the two races in the slaveholding States is an evil:–far otherwise; I hold it to be a good, as it has thus far proved itself to be to both, and will continue to prove so if not disturbed by the fell spirit of abolition.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">In the meantime, the white or European race, has not degenerated. It has kept pace with its brethren in other sections of the Union where slavery does not exist.

<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">. . . I hold that in the present state of civilization, where two races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other physical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, the relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, is, instead of an evil, a good—a positive good. . . <link target-id="fs-idm286956800">I hold then, that there never has yet existed a wealthy and civilized society in which one portion of the community did not, in point of fact, live on the labor of the other. . . .</link></entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">There is and always has been in an advanced stage of wealth and civilization, <link target-id="fs-idm180044960">a conflict between labor and capital</link>. The condition of society in the South exempts us from the disorders and dangers resulting from this conflict; and which explains why it is that the political condition of the slaveholding States has been so much more stable and quiet than that of the North.</entry>
