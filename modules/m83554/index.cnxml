<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm327168912">When a Cuban revolutionary movement began against Spain in 1895, Americans, heavily invested in Cuba’s sugar industry, took notice. In February 1898, President William McKinley dispatched the U.S. warship <emphasis effect="italics">Maine</emphasis> to Cuban waters. The unexplained explosion of the <emphasis effect="italics">Maine</emphasis>, the yellow press, and accounts of Spanish atrocities in Cuba all led to the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898. Public opinion in the United States was divided over this conflict. On March 17, 1898, Senator Redfield Proctor of Vermont gave a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate concerning conditions he found in Cuba shortly after the sinking of the <emphasis effect="italics">Maine</emphasis>. Mark Twain, the celebrated American author, commented extensively on U.S. actions overseas and became one of the most prominent members of the American Anti-Imperialist League.</para>

[The substance of (the <emphasis effect="bold">cablegram</emphasis>) was:] A tribe of <emphasis effect="bold">Moros</emphasis>, dark-skinned savages, had fortified themselves in the bowl of an extinct crater . . . as they were hostiles, and bitter against us because we have been trying for eight years to take their liberties away from them, their presence in that position was a menace. Our commander, Gen. Leonard Wood, ordered a reconnaissance. It was found that the Moros numbered six hundred, counting women and children; that their crater bowl was . . . very difficult of access for Christian troops and artillery. Then General Wood ordered a surprise, and went along himself to see the order carried out. Our troops climbed the heights by devious and difficult trails, and even took some artillery with them. . . . Apparently the contending parties were about equal as to number—six hundred men on our side, on the edge of the bowl; six hundred men, women and children in the bottom of the bowl. Depth of the bowl, 50 feet. . . .<newline/><newline/>The battle began [continuing for a day and a half] . . . our forces firing down into the crater with their artillery and their deadly small arms . . . ; the savages furiously returning the fire . . . [probably with] knives and clubs mainly; also ineffectual trade-muskets when they had any. . . .<newline/><newline/>General Wood was present and looking on. His order had been. “Kill <emphasis effect="italics">or</emphasis> capture those savages.” Apparently our little army considered that the “or” left them authorized to kill <emphasis effect="italics">or</emphasis> capture according to taste, and that their taste had remained what it has been for eight years . . . the taste of Christian butchers. . . .<newline/><newline/>There, with six hundred engaged on each side, we lost fifteen men killed outright, and . . . thirty-two wounded. . . . The enemy numbered six hundred—including women and children—and we abolished them utterly, leaving not even a baby alive to cry for its dead mother. <link target-id="fs-idm616929760"><emphasis effect="italics">This is incomparably the greatest victory that was ever achieved by the Christian soldiers of the United States.</emphasis></link></entry>
