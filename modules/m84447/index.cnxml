<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm382916592">President Franklin Roosevelt used calm and inspiring communication with American citizens through fireside chats and his State of the Union addresses. His communication style established firebreaks in the panic that followed in the wake of the Great Depression and harnessed the needed courage to respond to the 1941 military attack against Pearl Harbor. Three years into the war, Roosevelt chose to reassert the necessity of winning the economic war on poverty at home just as fascism had to be conquered in Europe. To accomplish this, the president wielded the political clout and trust he had developed with Americans to propose a Second Bill of Rights in his 1944 State of the Union address.</para>
