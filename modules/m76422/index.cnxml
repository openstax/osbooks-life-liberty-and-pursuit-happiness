<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm239234000">Judith Sargent Murray was among America's earliest champions of female equality. Murray was the oldest of eight children born to a wealthy ship-owning family in the colonial seaport of Gloucester, Massachusetts. As a child, Murray received a typical education for a daughter in a wealthy merchant family: reading, writing, and domestic activities such as sewing. Much of her knowledge beyond these topics was self-taught from perusing her family library. Murray wrote poetry from a young age but did not publish publicly until 1784, under the pen name Constantia. Her landmark essay “On the Equality of the Sexes” appeared in the March and April issues of the <emphasis effect="italics">Massachusetts Magazine</emphasis> in 1790. More poems, plays, and a book entitled <emphasis effect="italics">The Gleaner</emphasis> followed in 1798.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Is it upon mature consideration we adopt the idea, that nature is thus <emphasis effect="bold">partial</emphasis> in her distributions? Is it indeed a fact, that she hath yielded to one half of the human species so unquestionable a mental superiority? I know that to both sexes elevated understandings, and the reverse, are common. But, suffer me to ask, in what the minds of females are so notoriously deficient, or unequal. <link target-id="fs-idm235446560">May not the intellectual powers be ranged under these four heads—imagination, reason, memory and judgment</link>. The province of imagination hath long since been surrendered to us, and we have been crowned and undoubted sovereigns of the regions of fancy. . . . Observe the variety of fashions (here I bar the contemptuous smile) which distinguish and adorn the female world: how continually are they changing. . . . Now what a playfulness, what an exuberance of fancy, what strength of <emphasis effect="bold">inventine</emphasis> imagination, doth this continual variation discover? . . . <link target-id="fs-idm251362480">Another instance of our creative powers, is our talent for <emphasis effect="bold">slander</emphasis></link>; how ingenious are we at inventive scandal? what a formidable story can we in a moment fabricate merely from the force of a <emphasis effect="bold">prolifick</emphasis> imagination? how many reputations, in the fertile brain of a female, have been utterly <emphasis effect="bold">despoiled</emphasis>? how industrious are we at improving a hint? suspicion how easily do we convert into conviction. . . . Perhaps it will be asked if I furnish these facts as instances of excellency in our sex. Certainly not; but as proofs of a creative <emphasis effect="bold">faculty</emphasis>, of a lively imagination. Assuredly great activity of mind is thereby discovered, and was this activity properly directed, what beneficial effects would follow. Is the needle and kitchen sufficient to employ the operations of a soul thus organized? <link target-id="fs-idm257025248">I should conceive not. . . .</link> Are we <emphasis effect="bold">deficient</emphasis> in reason? we can only reason from what we know, and if an opportunity of acquiring knowledge hath been denied us, the inferiority of our sex cannot fairly be deduced from thence. Memory, I believe, will be allowed us in common, since everyone's experience must testify, that a <emphasis effect="bold">loquacious</emphasis> old woman is as frequently met with, as a communicative man. . . .</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="bold">sage</emphasis> (adj): wise<newline/><newline/>
<emphasis effect="bold">learned lady:</emphasis> Note: <emphasis effect="italics">The Learned Ladies</emphasis> (<emphasis effect="italics">Les Femmes savantes</emphasis>) was a sarcastic comedy written by the French playwright Molière in 1672. Murray is demonstrating her own education by using a play on this title.</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Yet it may be questioned, from what doth this superiority, in this determining faculty of the soul, proceed. May we not trace its source in the difference of education, and continued advantages? Will it be said that the judgment of a male of two years old, is more <emphasis effect="bold">sage</emphasis> than that of a female's of the same age? I believe the reverse is generally observed to be true. But from that period what partiality! <link target-id="fs-idm258212096">how is the one exalted, and the other depressed, by the contrary modes of education which are adopted!</link> the one is taught to aspire, and the other is early confined and limitted. As their years increase, the sister must be wholly domesticated, while the brother is led by the hand through all the flowery paths of science. Grant that their minds are by nature equal, yet who shall wonder at the <emphasis effect="italics">apparent</emphasis> superiority, if indeed custom becomes <emphasis effect="italics">second nature</emphasis>; nay if it taketh place of nature, and that it doth the experience of each day will evince. At length arrived at womanhood, the uncultivated fair one feels a void, which the employments allotted her are by no means capable of filling. What can she do? to books she may not apply; or if she doth, <link target-id="fs-idm256232336"><emphasis effect="italics">to those only of the novel kind,</emphasis></link> lest she merit the appellation of a <link target-id="fs-idm206510112"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">learned lady</emphasis></emphasis></link>; and what ideas have been affixed to this term, the observation of many can testify. . . . Now, was she permitted the same instructors as her brother, (with an eye however to their particular departments) for the employment of a rational mind an ample field would be opened. . . .</entry>

<emphasis effect="bold">avocation</emphasis> (n): hobby<newline/><newline/>
<emphasis effect="bold">vociferate</emphasis> (v): to shout or yell</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Will it be urged that those acquirements would supersede our domestick duties. I answer that every requisite in female economy is easily attained; and, with truth I can add, that when once attained, they require no further <emphasis effect="italics">mental attention</emphasis>. Nay, while we are pursuing the needle, or the <emphasis effect="bold">superintendency</emphasis> of the family, I repeat, that our minds are at full liberty for reflection; that imagination may exert itself in full vigor; and that if a just foundation is early laid, our ideas will then be worthy of rational beings. If we were industrious we might easily find time to arrange them upon paper, or should <emphasis effect="bold">avocations</emphasis> press too hard for such an indulgence, the hours allotted for conversation would at least become more refined and rational. Should it still be <emphasis effect="bold">vociferated</emphasis>, “Your domestick employments are sufficient”—I would calmly ask, is it reasonable, that a candidate for immortality, for the joys of heaven, an intelligent being, who is to spend an eternity in contemplating the works of the Deity, should at present be so degraded, as to be allowed no other ideas, than those which are suggested by the mechanism of a pudding, <link target-id="fs-idm248500112">or the sewing the seams of a garment?</link> Pity that all such censurers of female improvement do not go one step further, and deny their future existence; to be consistent they surely ought.</entry>

I dare confidently believe, that from the commencement of time to the present day, there hath been as many females, as males, who, by the <emphasis effect="italics">mere force of natural powers,</emphasis> have merited the crown of applause; who, <emphasis effect="italics">thus unassisted</emphasis>, have seized the wreath of fame . . . for <emphasis effect="italics">equality only,</emphasis> we wish to contend.</entry>
