<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm463957040">On January 20, 1961, Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren administered the oath of office to the thirty-fifth president, John F. Kennedy, during a televised inauguration ceremony. Kennedy was elected during a political climate that threatened the possibility of nuclear war against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union’s communist system of government and the fear of the spread of communist ideology was the topic of Kennedy’s speech, but he also called for a new generation of American and global citizens to unite against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself. In his speech, President Kennedy urged U.S. citizens to participate in public service and “ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.”</para>

For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. <link target-id="fs-idm459256736">And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God</link>.</entry>

Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage—and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.</entry>

<row valign="top">
<entry valign="top" align="left"> </entry>

I do not shrink from this responsibility—I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it—and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.</entry>

With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God’s work must truly be our own.</entry>
