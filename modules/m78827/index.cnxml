<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm400178096">In the fall of 1789, Congress directed Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to deliver a report on the new nation’s public finances and to propose a way of paying the debt to establish a solid footing for American credit. Hamilton’s report proposed for the federal government to assume all states’ debts and use federal tariffs (i.e., taxes on imports) and excise taxes to pay the debt gradually. Opposition to the plan was centered in the South, with members of Congress fearing Hamilton’s centralizing policies including taxes. Virginia, Maryland, and Georgia had already paid off most of their debts. They had little interest in now being on the hook for debts other states had failed to pay off. Meanwhile, representatives argued over placement of the permanent capital in different cities, including New York, Philadelphia, or Virginia. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson recounts that he helped engineer a compromise by bringing together Hamilton and Representative James Madison to hammer out a compromise over dinner. The result was that Hamilton’s financial plan passed Congress and a permanent capital was established at Washington, DC, in 1800 after a temporary residence in Philadelphia. Jefferson’s account of “The Compromise of 1790” is found in the introduction to the “Anas” from February 4, 1818. The “Anas” was a compilation of Jefferson’s writings. The origins of this publication are still unclear.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">I proposed to him (Hamilton) however to dine with me the next day, and I would invite another friend or two, bring them into conference together, and I thought it impossible that reasonable men, consulting together coolly, could fail, by some mutual sacrifices of opinion, <link target-id="fs-idm400230560">to form a compromise which was to save the union</link>. The discussion took place. I could take no part in it, but an <emphasis effect="bold">exhortatory</emphasis> one, because I was a stranger to the circumstances which should govern it. But it was finally agreed that, whatever importance had been attached to the rejection of this proposition, the preservation of the union, &amp; of <emphasis effect="bold">concord</emphasis> among the states was more important, and that therefore it would be better that the vote of rejection should be <emphasis effect="bold">rescinded</emphasis>, <link target-id="fs-idm381268688">to effect which some members should change their votes</link>. But it was observed that this pill would be peculiarly bitter to the Southern States, and that some <emphasis effect="bold">concomitant</emphasis> measure should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them. There had before been propositions to fix the seat of government either at Philadelphia, or at Georgetown on the Potomac; and it was thought that by giving it to Philadelphia for ten years, and to Georgetown permanently afterwards, <link target-id="fs-idm405713648">this might, as an <emphasis effect="bold">anodyne</emphasis></link>, calm in some degree the ferment which might be excited by the other measure alone. <link target-id="fs-idm399807664">So two of the Potomac members (White &amp; Lee, but White with a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive) agreed to change their votes, &amp; Hamilton undertook to carry the other point.</link></entry>
