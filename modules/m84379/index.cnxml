<para id="fs-idm497452960">During the spring of 1927, the international competition to become the first aviator to fly 3,000 miles nonstop across the Atlantic from New York to Paris (or vice versa) was heating up. Pilots hoped to win the Orteig Prize of $25,000 for accomplishing the feat, as well as lasting fame and publicity. The challenge enthralled American and European imaginations, while mass culture heralded fliers as romantic heroes emblematic of technological progress and individual gallantry. Pilots from around the world courted the dangers of flying to be the first to achieve historic flights.</para>
<para id="fs-idm221532832">Rapid technological strides had been made in the airplane in World War I and it was used during the conflict for reconnaissance and then for bombing and strafing missions. Reports of aerial dogfights created popular images of chivalrous and daring pilots. In 1919, three U.S. Navy seaplanes (with multiple pilots) attempted to fly from New York to England over several hops, and one plane made it. In 1923, two U.S. Army pilots flew across the continental United States. In 1926, Richard Byrd and Floyd Bennett flew across the North Pole. In 1926 and 1927, several aviators were preparing to attempt the seemingly impossible and fly nonstop between New York and Paris. Michigan native Charles Lindbergh took up the challenge (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_CLindbergh"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm211817280">Lindbergh was born in 1902, just a year before the Wright brothers‚Äô historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 1922, he made his first flight and instantly fell in love with flying airplanes. ‚ÄúMy early flying seemed an experience beyond mortality. There was the earth spreading out below me, a planet where I had lived but from which I had astonishingly risen,‚Äù he wrote.</para>
<para id="fs-idm178697520">Lindbergh piloted planes and also studied every detail of the way they worked. He went on barnstorming tours of the Midwest and West, where he performed stunts and gave rides to the public. From a sense of patriotic duty and to perfect his flying, he joined the Army Air Service in 1924. Over the next two years, he delivered air mail on the Chicago‚ÄìSt. Louis route. He had to bail out of his plane three times and had the good fortune to survive each parachute landing. Still, nothing would stop this intrepid pilot from braving danger to fly.</para>
<para id="fs-idm214644864">Early in 1927, Lindbergh raised $10,000 from financial backers in St. Louis. The Ryan Aircraft Corporation in San Diego agreed to build a plane to his specifications for approximately that amount. He arrived in San Diego and worked closely with engineers on every aspect of design and production, intent on building the plane to be as light as possible. The <emphasis effect="italics">Spirit of St. Louis</emphasis> was a single-seat monoplane with a wingspan of 46 feet and a fuselage 28-feet long. It had a single Wright J-5 air-cooled engine and could hold 450 gallons of fuel. While it was being built, Lindberg pored over navigation charts and plotted his course across the Atlantic.</para>
<para id="fs-idm464760864">On April 28, Lindbergh took the <emphasis effect="italics">Spirit</emphasis> on its maiden test flight and afterward proclaimed, ‚ÄúThis is a very good airplane.‚Äù During the next 10 days, he flew it for 28 hours to learn its idiosyncrasies. On May 10, he flew from San Diego to St. Louis at night to practice the Atlantic crossing and made it despite some engine trouble. He then flew from St. Louis to Long Island and set the transcontinental speed record of 21 hours and 20 minutes of total flight across the country. During the next week, storms over the Atlantic grounded Lindbergh and the other aspirants for the Orteig Prize. In addition to this setback, Lindbergh was incensed at being hounded by reporters taking his photograph and asking questions for their stories.</para>
<para id="fs-idm184391808">On the evening of May 19, Lindbergh and some friends were making their way to a Broadway play when they stopped to call a meteorologist. They heard one of the most significant weather reports of the century when they learned that a high-pressure system would soon clear out the Atlantic storms. They raced back to Long Island so Lindbergh could nap‚Äîhe faced approximately 35 hours in the air without sleep‚Äîpicked up a few sandwiches for the flight, and then prepped the plane before returning to the hotel. A friend was posted at the door to keep away the press. Just as Lindbergh was falling asleep, his friend knocked loudly on the door and asked, ‚ÄúSlim, what am I going to do when you‚Äôre gone?‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm198103360">Foiled in his attempt to sleep, Lindbergh went down to Curtiss Field at 3:00 a.m. and made some last-minute checks. At 4:15 a.m., the <emphasis effect="italics">Spirit of St. Louis</emphasis> was towed to nearby Roosevelt Field, where his competitors‚Äô planes sat idle in the hanger. The plane‚Äôs tanks were filled with 450 gallons of fuel. The rain had stopped as expected, but the air was still cold and damp as the sun rose. A few hours later, at 7:40 a.m., Lindbergh climbed aboard his plane (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_11_03_SpiritStLo"/>).</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm490313184">Lindbergh started the <emphasis effect="italics">Spirit</emphasis>, and it responded somewhat sluggishly because of the humidity. He did not know whether the plane, heavily laden with fuel and supplies, could clear the telephone wires hanging at the end of the soggy 5,000-foot runway, let alone fly 3,400 miles across a broad expanse of ocean. He turned to his crew with his boyish grin and said, ‚ÄúWhat do you say‚Äîlet‚Äôs try it.‚Äù With 500 spectators holding their breath, Lindbergh strapped himself in and pulled down his goggles. At 7:51 a.m., he throttled the plane forward, and it bounced on the runway twice before finally lifting into the skies to a great cheer from below.</para>
<para id="fs-idm206997680">Lindbergh followed the New England coast to the northeast. He later wrote, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving up the continent and heading out to sea in the most fragile vehicle ever devised by man.‚Äù By the time he flew over Nova Scotia at noon, he had been awake for more than 30 hours and was already battling great fatigue. He wrote, ‚ÄúMy whole body agrees dully that nothing, nothing life can attain is quite so desirable as sleep. My mind is losing resolution and control.‚Äù After 11 hours in the cockpit flying at 100 miles per hour, Lindbergh passed over Newfoundland at dusk, where he buzzed a fishing town that was home to the last humans he would see for nearly 2,000 miles. Soon, night closed over him.</para>
<para id="fs-idm182637296">Meanwhile, at Yankee Stadium in New York, the announcer for a heavyweight championship boxing match between Jack Sharkey and Tom Maloney asked the crowd for a moment of silence to think about ‚Äúa boy up there tonight who is carrying the hopes of all. . . Americans.‚Äù Humorist Will Rogers penned a newspaper piece that stated, ‚ÄúNo jokes today. An odd, tall, slim, smiling, bashful boy is somewhere out there over the middle of the ocean. . . But this kid ain‚Äôt going to fail.‚Äù The hopes of millions of Americans, and people around the world, were invested in Lindbergh as he braved the void between the new world and the old.</para>
<para id="fs-idm463398400">Lindbergh encountered a thick fog over the Atlantic and climbed to nearly 10,000 feet to escape it, but ice built up on his wings and threatened to down the plane. He descended again and navigated the fog by using his instruments. He flew around thunderstorms and squalls as he fought off sleep. Even though he opened the window to allow frigid air and even the spray from the tops of the waves to keep him awake, he was losing the battle against fatigue. He started to see phantoms in the cockpit as he drifted off to sleep and once rescued the plane from a steep dive. Even while awake, he suffered hallucinations of landfall.</para>
<para id="fs-idm212650544">As he flew low over the waves, seagulls soon filled the skies, a hopeful sign of land nearby. Finally, the unmistakable cliffs of the coast of Ireland came into view, with boats full of surprised fishermen dotting the waters. Lindbergh was ecstatic to see that he was precisely on course and even happier to learn that a favorable tailwind had shaved a few hours off his flight.</para>
<para id="fs-idm222709376">Lindbergh still had more than 600 miles ahead of him, and the sun was setting again. He crossed the comparatively narrow English Channel and flew over northern France on his way to Paris. When he arrived over the city, he circled the Eiffel Tower and searched for Le Bourget airfield. Thousands of lights guided him, which turned out to be a huge traffic jam of excited Parisians heading to the airfield in welcome.</para>
<para id="fs-idm207139088">Lindbergh finally landed <emphasis effect="italics">Spirit of St. Louis</emphasis> at 10:24 p.m. local time on May 21 and taxied to the hanger, where as many as 150,000 onlookers hoped to catch a glimpse of the historic plane and the heroic pilot who flew it. The massive crowd gathered around him and began to tear at his clothes and at the plane, desperate for a souvenir. Excited Parisians carried Lindbergh on their shoulders until he was whisked away and taken to the American embassy for a steak dinner and a well-earned night of sleep after his 33.5-hour flight.</para>
<para id="fs-idm225261872">Lindbergh had done the impossible by flying solo across the Atlantic. He was honored in the United States with a ticker-tape parade, an appearance before Congress, a Distinguished Flying Cross, the Congressional Medal of Honor, and the Orteig Prize. He signed a book deal and went on a speaking tour, but he humbly turned down numerous other lucrative offers. President Calvin Coolidge said Lindbergh‚Äôs success was ‚Äúthe same story of valor and victory by a son of the people that shines through every page of American history.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm203757936">His achievement helped to grow the nascent commercial airline industry over the next decade by encouraging cooperation between business and government. In addition to civilian uses, the airplane had significant military applications in World War II. Lindbergh‚Äôs flight made him a hero at a time when other celebrities such as Clara Bow, Charlie Chaplin, and Babe Ruth were becoming a part of the new consumer culture of movies, radio, and advertising.</para>
