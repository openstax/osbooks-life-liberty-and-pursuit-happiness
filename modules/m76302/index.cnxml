<para id="fs-idm226468976">The reliance of Spain on the cooperation, tribute, and labor of Native Americans and Africans drastically shaped life in colonial Spanish America. Daily life was a complex combination of compliance and rebellion, order and disorder, affluence and poverty. On the one hand, Spaniards relied on Native Americans for labor, tribute, and assistance in governing the many Native American towns. On the other hand, many Native Americans realized the benefits of accommodating the Spaniards to maintain traditional ways of life. In short, cooperation served the interests of both parties, although it was negotiated daily.</para>
<para id="fs-idm236148592">Upon their arrival in the New World, Spaniards constructed their colonies and cities upon or alongside established Native American communities such as the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_01_03_Tenochitl"/>), on the site that later became Mexico City. To establish political and economic control over their new colonies, the Spaniards created two ‚Äúrepublics‚Äù: the <emphasis effect="italics">Rep√∫blica de Espa√±oles</emphasis> and the <emphasis effect="italics">Rep√∫blica de Indios</emphasis>. They and their enslaved Africans (and even free Africans) were in the first, and Native Americans were in the second. Although both republics fell under the purview of Spanish law, they operated semi-autonomously, with each established town having its own town council. For example, Mexico City had both a Spanish and a Native American town council.</para>

<caption>At its height, Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities in the world, with a population of up to 200,000. After the conquest of the Aztec empire, the Spanish appropriated this floating city as their capital. Note the flag of Imperial Spain at the top left of the island city.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm234643536">The town councils governed the daily affairs of each town and its inhabitants in each respective republic. Councils in Native American towns were run by Native American officers, often those who already held positions of power. For example, the Maya ruler in most preexisting Maya towns became the governor of the colonial town council. The Native American nobility in each town filled other local government positions. In short, the establishment of the republics, their towns, and their respective town councils allowed the Native Americans a great deal of autonomy and gave the original Native American elite a way to maintain their positions of authority in daily life. The Spanish relied heavily on these Native American elites not only to maintain order in the towns but also to redirect their systems of tribute into the hands of the Spaniards and assist in the establishment of Catholicism in their towns.</para>
<para id="fs-idm217270928">As subjects of Spain, Native Americans had various daily responsibilities. As Christians, they were to attend services and send their children to daily catechism classes. They also paid various religious fees and taxes designed to support the Church in the Spanish colonies. Local priests and officers of the Inquisition (a Roman Catholic tribunal established to investigate and suppress heresy) maintained spiritual order and orthodoxy among all inhabitants of the colonies. In addition, Native Americans had labor and tribute quotas to fill. Such duties provided many opportunities for confrontation and discontent, and the local Native American elite adjudicated many such situations through the town council. Indeed, the archives are full of petitions by Native American councils against corrupt priests and Spanish officials and complaints against excessive tribute quotas. Yet the council likewise mediated local affairs, including land disputes, bills of sale, and the filling of town positions. It even meted out punishments for wrongdoing. In many ways, the town councils in the <emphasis effect="italics">Rep√∫blica de Indios</emphasis> allowed Native Americans to continue governing Native Americans.</para>
<para id="fs-idm238467248">To govern and tax the Native Americans in the early decades of colonization, the Spanish relied on the <emphasis effect="italics">encomienda</emphasis>, a grant of native labor and tribute given to Spanish conquistadors and settlers. Abuse and distrust of the system led to its gradual and sometimes incomplete phasing out, with control over Native American tribute and labor reverting to the crown, which tried to control corrupt colonial officials.</para>
<para id="fs-idm242297472">Tribute varied according to region and era but included mainly goods Spaniards could ship back to Spain for profit or sell on the local or regional market. Products presented as tribute included maize from Culhuacan, silk from the Mixteca Alta region, honey from Yucatan, pearls from the Caribbean, gold from Columbia, and even cattle from Argentina. After the initial years of colonization, Spaniards in central Mexico organized Native American labor around the <emphasis effect="italics">repartimiento</emphasis>, or ‚Äúallotment,‚Äù system. The <emphasis effect="italics">repartimiento</emphasis> required those between the ages of eighteen and fifty years to give service in a variety of projects, from laboring in a Spaniard‚Äôs field to participating in large construction projects. The Native Americans were to receive payment for their labors, but it was often insufficient or withheld. In South America, labor was organized through the <emphasis effect="italics">mita,</emphasis> an Incan system in which adult Native Americans were drafted for extended periods. For example, the silver mines of Potos√≠ required the labor of thousands of Andean laborers, who were drafted from towns hundreds of miles away and required to serve one year of every seven (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_01_03_Capitulo"/>). Eventually, the decline in the Native American population and difficulties with the forced-labor system led to the development of wage labor.</para>
<figure id="BRI_APUSH_01_03_Capitulo" class="scaled-down-60">

<caption>The rich silver deposits of the Cerro Rico mountain in Potosi, in present-day Bolivia, supplied Spain with immense wealth in the sixteenth century. The Spanish appropriated the Incan system of labor tribute known as the <emphasis effect="italics">mita</emphasis> to ensure a constant source of labor in the mines.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm222356912">Although Native American tribute and labor served as the linchpin of colonial society, Africans also contributed to the daily life of the Spanish colonies. In general, Spaniards employed native labor whenever possible. However, where the supply was insufficient, they purchased African slaves to work in the more profitable industries such as mining and sugar. For example, after the decimation of the native population in the Caribbean, Spaniards brought thousands of enslaved people from West Africa to work the islands‚Äô sugarcane fields. This drastically altered the Caribbean‚Äôs population demographics. Not all enslaved Africans worked in the mines or sugar plantations. In the cities and large towns, they were rented out and served in other domestic roles, including as wet nurses and maids. Africans also learned the skilled trades of their owners and became proficient tailors, blacksmiths, and artisans.</para>
<para id="fs-idm246095936">Because Spanish law allowed an enslaved person to purchase his or her own freedom, Spain‚Äôs colonies boasted a sizeable portion of free blacks who engaged in myriad trades; freed slaves became sailors, merchants, and even slave owners. Many joined militias and defended thousands of miles of coastline along the Spanish colonies against pirates‚Äîanother common element of life in the colonies. They served in return for a salary, social advancement, and tax exemption. Moreover, free Africans formed their own Catholic brotherhoods‚Äîcommon among Spaniards and Native Americans‚Äîthat supported an African-Christian worldview while providing monetary support for members by funding funerals and celebrations and even serving as banks.</para>
<para id="fs-idm224595136">Spanish cities and the activities within them modeled those found in Europe. Like their counterparts in Spain, the capitals of Mexico City and Lima housed universities, cathedrals, exquisite homes, central courthouses, and exclusive shopping. Cards, music, books, plays, bullfights, and parties occupied the time of the elite. Poorer citizens also partook in such activities but on a smaller scale, enjoying local ballads, cockfights, and town gatherings on feast days. The elite dined on wheat bread, olive oil, cured meats, and wine, while commoners ate maize tortillas, manioc, chilies, turkeys, and small dogs, and drank the local indigenous intoxicant. Cities boasted the most refinement and Spanish influence, whereas the countryside was denigrated for its overwhelming ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù feel.</para>
<para id="fs-idm235290448">Throughout the colonial period, sexual relations between different people from the Americas, Europe, and Africa created a growing mixed-race population known as the <term><emphasis effect="italics">castas</emphasis></term> (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_01_03_Casta"/>). Disregarded as a minor inconvenience at first, the <emphasis effect="italics">castas</emphasis> eventually threatened the social hierarchy. The Spanish sought to maintain themselves at the top and keep Native Americans and Africans at the bottom, whereas the <emphasis effect="italics">castas</emphasis> were allowed a place somewhere in the middle. In daily life, however, people were often racially categorized by how well they spoke Spanish, how they dressed, what food they ate, or their social circle of acquaintances. As a result, in practice, the hierarchy allowed for some flexibility.</para>
<figure id="BRI_APUSH_01_03_Casta" class="full-width">
<media id="fs-idm208641344" alt="Part a and part b both show paintings depicting mixed race families.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/BRI_APUSH_01_03_Casta.jpg"/>
</media>
<caption><emphasis effect="italics">Castas</emphasis> paintings from the mid-1700s document the cultural blending seen in Spanish colonies. Do these images support the assertion that there was a degree of social mobility in the Spanish colonies? Why or why not?</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm246316608">Perhaps this flexibility best reflects life in the Spanish colonies. It consisted of specific obligations, religious institutions, and social hierarchies, to be sure. Yet Native Americans, Africans, and Spaniards negotiated their own experiences, from conformity to resistance, within these limits. Most lived somewhere between the two extremes, doing their best to adapt their traditional ways of life to a diverse colonial world.</para>
