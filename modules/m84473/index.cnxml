<para id="fs-idm504076512">Black Americans overwhelmingly approved of the Supreme Court‚Äôs unanimous 1954 decision in <term><emphasis effect="italics">Brown v. Board of Education</emphasis></term>. In resolving a lawsuit brought by Thurgood Marshall‚Äôs NAACP legal team, the Court‚Äôs ruling in the case prohibited public school segregation, largely on the basis of the psychological and emotional damage it inflicted on African American children. But the ruling was hampered by its implementation order of May 1955, which famously declared that public schools should desegregate ‚Äúwith all deliberate speed.‚Äù In response, white supremacists launched a campaign across the South of ‚Äúmassive resistance‚Äù led by the White Citizens‚Äô Council movement and the revitalized Ku Klux Klan (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_03_LittleRock"/>). This fierce opposition now had plenty of time to mobilize its forces, with lawsuits and boycotts backed by terrorism.</para>

<para id="fs-idm198630240">Black families were hopeful for the long run but dreaded the short run, fearing violent retaliation for integration efforts. In Little Rock, Arkansas, soon after the <emphasis effect="italics">Brown</emphasis> decision, 12-year-old Melba Beals was assaulted on her way home from school by a white man who yelled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you niggers the Supreme Court can‚Äôt run my life,‚Äù as he tried to tear off her clothes. She fought back and got away.</para>
<para id="fs-idm522949360">When the Little Rock school board and state NAACP decided to integrate Central High School in the fall of 1957, Beals courageously signed up to go, supported by her mother and grandmother. She and eight other African American students were chosen from 100 who volunteered.</para>
<para id="fs-idm496515344">In early September 1957, Governor Orval Faubus ordered the Arkansas National Guard to block the black juniors and seniors, dubbed the ‚ÄúLittle Rock Nine,‚Äù from entering the school. Because she had not received a phone call that the Little Rock Nine were not going to go to school on the first day, 15-year-old Elizabeth Eckford was alone when she faced the white mob‚Äôs cruel taunts and threats. With the guardsmen refusing to intervene on her behalf, the mobs grew in size and threat. Eckford was chased by angry whites and barely escaped the dangerous situation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm643939744">Federal judge Ronald Davies tried to counter the governor‚Äôs efforts to thwart the desegregation plan, which had been two years in the making. When Davies ordered Faubus to remove the Guard, the nine children were admitted into the school (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_03_LittleR9"/>), but they were treated viciously by some white students. When she felt threatened, Beals tried to escape into a gym class, but a mob led by white mothers invaded the school and came after her. ‚ÄúGet the nigger,‚Äù a woman screamed. Another knocked her down. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs bleeding. What do you know. Niggers bleed red blood. Let‚Äôs kick the nigger.‚Äù Beals ran a gantlet of punches, kicks, and spit until she got free. The other eight faced similar traumatic experiences trying to get an education.The mob was so overpowering that a scared school leader confided: ‚ÄúWe may have to let the mob have one of these kids. . . It may be the only way out. There must be a thousand people out there, armed and coming this way.‚Äù</para>

<para id="fs-idm518579632">All nine got out, but the attacks grew worse during the week. Though opposed to the <emphasis effect="italics">Brown</emphasis> decision, President Dwight Eisenhower bowed to liberal and popular pressure and sent in the military to prevent the violence from spiraling out of control. From the Oval Office he justified his decision: ‚ÄúMob rule in Little Rock menaces the very safety of the United States and the free world.‚Äù Twelve hundred battle-equipped, bayonet-wielding paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division, in 52 planeloads, descended on Central High and escorted the students to school past racist slurs and threats. Soldiers were assigned to protect each student during the school day.</para>
<para id="fs-idm504439872">Though the soldiers stayed only a few weeks, desegregation took hold by fits and starts. The Little Rock Nine made friends with some white students and broke down the resistance. However, the struggle for the individual students continued. Minnijean Brown was suspended on several occasions after incidents provoked by white students. Finally she was expelled, to the delight of many white students who adopted the slogan ‚ÄúOne down, eight to go.‚Äù Ernest Green graduated at the end of the school year. However, Governor Faubus closed the Little Rock high schools during the next school year, and politicians in other states did likewise. The court later overturned this move. Only three of the Little Rock Nine graduated from Central High; most of the others left and graduated from other schools (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_03_Time"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm502419040">Despite <emphasis effect="italics">Brown v. Board</emphasis>, only small numbers of students attended integrated schools across the South, delaying progress even further. The civil rights movement had aimed to achieve full public-school integration by 1963 (even with many whites switching to private schools). But southern schools were not significantly integrated until the early 1970s, and then only under strong federal pressure. In the North, de facto segregation of neighborhoods essentially led to segregation of schools in local communities. Decades after the Little Rock Nine had made their stand, schools in the South and North were as segregated as ever because of entrenched socioeconomic divisions. Nevertheless, the process had started, because of actions by the branches of the national government but also, and perhaps more importantly, because of the courage of the Little Rock Nine and other African American students like them.</para>
