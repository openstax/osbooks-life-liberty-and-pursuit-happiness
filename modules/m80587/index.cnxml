<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm482290336">On May 11, 1846, President James K. Polk sent a special message to Congress asking for a declaration of war against Mexico. In his message, the president outlined a series of grievances against the Mexican government and argued that the Mexicans had started a war by attacking U.S. soldiers in southern Texas. Congress declared war two days after the message, but the debate continued over the war and the expansion of slavery in the West. Congressman Joshua Giddings of Ohio issued a scathing reply to Polk two days later and accused the president of starting a war of conquest to safeguard slavery. Giddings was not alone in his beliefs; many northerners and opponents of slavery especially feared that the conflict was an excuse for the expansion of slavery.</para>

But though present on the Mexican soil by agreement between the two Governments, invested with full powers, and bearing evidence of the most friendly dispositions, his mission has been unavailing.

I will lend it no aid, no support whatever.
