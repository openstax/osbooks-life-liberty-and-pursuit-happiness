<title>I. Warm-up Activity (5‚Äì10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm399239296">Ask students to turn to one another in small groups and list some examples of individual property. After giving students a few minutes to discuss the question, call for their responses and write on the board a few examples that they mention. They may think first of physical things like clothes, phone, car, house, and land. Ask students to identify which of the items in their list are physical belongings. If they have listed types of property that are not physical belongings, have them also identify those. If their initial list is only physical belongings, directly ask them to think of some things that belong to individuals but are not tangibles, and to individually jot those down on their own paper. Meanwhile, draw a large circle on the board (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_04_07_Property_HO"/>) and label the circle ‚ÄúProperty.‚Äù Divide the circle in half and label one half ‚ÄúPhysical Property: My Stuff,‚Äù listing a few examples of tangible property that students already listed in that half. Then ask students to give you some examples to list in the other half.</para>
<para id="fs-idm396337168">Tell students that, at the Founding, the word ‚Äúproperty‚Äù had a broader meaning than what probably comes to mind first for modern readers. James Madison published an essay exploring the definition of ‚Äúproperty‚Äù in the <emphasis effect="italics">National Gazette</emphasis> on March 29, 1792. He noted that the term includes ‚Äúthe external things of the world,‚Äù but also refers to ‚Äúevery thing to which a man may attach a value and have a right; and <emphasis effect="italics">which leaves to every one else the like advantage</emphasis>‚Äù (emphasis original). Madison continued to explain that this means that a person‚Äôs property includes opinions, the right to communicate those opinions, religious beliefs, safety, liberty, and the kind of work one wants to do. Madison wrote, ‚ÄúIn a word, as a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.‚Äù Close by writing this quote on the board under your diagram of types of property.</para>
<para id="fs-idm396723936">Tell students that in this lesson, whenever they think of the concept of property, they will use a broad understanding, including more than just tangible objects.</para>
