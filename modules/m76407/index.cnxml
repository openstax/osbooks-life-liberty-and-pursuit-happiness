<para id="fs-idm396345984">The Battle of New York was a disaster for General George Washington and his Continental Army. In the summer of 1776, thirty-two thousand British and <term>Hessian</term> mercenary troops routed the Continentals on Long Island. With the advantage of unchallenged naval supremacy in the waters around New York, the Royal Navy outflanked the Americans and could land troops anywhere. The British soldiers chased the Continental Army across Manhattan. By November, they had captured Fort Washington, but not the man for whom it was named, who had retreated across the Hudson River to New Jersey.</para>
<para id="fs-idm374863952">British generals William Howe and Charles Cornwallis closely pursued Washington as he raced through the New Jersey countryside. By late November, Washington‚Äôs army was dwindling rapidly. Thousands of enlistments were expiring and hundreds of men simply returned to their farms. Washington, who only had thirty-seven hundred soldiers (although William Heath had four thousand in New York, and Charles Lee had seventy-five hundred in northwestern New Jersey), fruitlessly begged General Lee to send him troops. In early December, Washington reached Trenton and crossed the Delaware, taking all the boats for miles around to prevent them from falling into British hands. Knowing the British could simply wait for the river to freeze and threaten Philadelphia, a terrified Congress fled the city, but not before entrusting Washington with nearly unlimited powers to fight the war.</para>
<para id="fs-idm393315456">With many of his men lacking shoes and adequate clothing, and often going hungry, Washington had warned Congress that ‚Äúten days more will put an end to the existence of our army.‚Äù Revolutionary financier and merchant Robert Morris then dispatched wagons of supplies to the army from Philadelphia. To help the army persevere during its darkest hour, Thomas Paine (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_03_03_PainePort"/>), author of <emphasis effect="italics">Common Sense</emphasis>, bolstered American morale with stirring words in a new pamphlet, <emphasis effect="italics">The American Crisis</emphasis>:</para>
<quote id="fs-idm402186224">These are the times that try men‚Äôs souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.</quote>

<para id="fs-idm390545424">On December 14, with the apparent end of the campaigning season, the British commanders marched back to New York to enter winter quarters. They left only a small garrison of Hessians at Trenton under the command of Colonel Johann Rall, who neglected his duty to build defenses around the town. A week later, two thousand new American soldiers arrived at Washington‚Äôs camp.</para>
<para id="fs-idm389727248">Washington faced a moment of decision. The enlistments of thousands of men would expire on January 1, 1777, so he decided to launch a bold strike against the garrison at Trenton on Christmas Day. As darkness fell, a <term>nor‚Äôeaster</term> raged, deluging the men with rain, hail, and snow. The temperature plummeted and the winds howled.</para>
<para id="fs-idm396507312">Three different army groups were supposed to cross the Delaware for the attack, but the two southern groups failed because of the turbulent river. After it successfully landed ten miles above Trenton, Washington‚Äôs group split into two columns, advancing through severe weather that many men had to endure shoeless with bloody, frozen feet. The two forces descended upon the town from the north and west several hours behind schedule, around eight o‚Äôclock in the morning on December 26.</para>
<para id="fs-idm396231568">Contrary to myth, the Hessians were not sleeping off drunkenness from Christmas celebrations, but they did not expect an attack in such wintry weather and had relaxed their guard. Roused from their beds by the first shots fired when Washington‚Äôs forces entered the town, they suffered one hundred casualties. Nine hundred surrendered, and five hundred escaped. Only a handful of Americans were wounded, including Virginian James Monroe. Washington told a general, ‚ÄúThis is a glorious day for our country.‚Äù The Americans went back across the Delaware with the victory they so desperately needed.</para>
<para id="fs-idm380310864">Washington and his generals wanted to strike again before the enlistments expired, especially when British general Charles Cornwallis marched from New York with eight thousand redcoats. So the American army crossed the Delaware yet again, this time as arctic temperatures froze the river and allowed most of the men to walk across (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_03_03_WashCross"/>). They brought thirty guns, took up positions in Trenton, and slept in the bitter cold.</para>

<para id="fs-idm393441392">On December 31, Washington offered the men a generous ten-dollar bounty for six more weeks of service. Some took the offer, but no one else stepped forward until Washington made this patriotic appeal:</para>
<quote id="fs-idm396269920">My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses, and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with the fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty, and to your country, which you probably can never do under any other circumstances.</quote>
<para id="fs-idm394309968">Many men agreed, and Washington‚Äôs army grew to almost seven thousand men. On January 2, after Cornwallis‚Äôs army had marched on Trenton and skirmished with American forces, the British general chose to delay, confidently saying of Washington, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got the old fox safe now. We‚Äôll go over and bag him in the morning.‚Äù That evening, the British observed the Americans lighting campfires and making a lot of noise in camp, and they fell for the ruse. Most of Washington‚Äôs forces were quietly slipping away toward Princeton in the night.</para>
<para id="fs-idm396301056">Washington‚Äôs men completed the ten-mile march over ice and snow and encountered the British garrison at Princeton at dawn. There, however, they faltered until Washington rode up and valiantly rallied his troops to turn the tide. ‚ÄúParade with us!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúThere is but a handful of the enemy, and we will have them directly!‚Äù The army drove on to the college, where Alexander Hamilton‚Äôs artillerymen blasted the British garrison. Meanwhile, when Cornwallis discovered he had been duped, he marched on Princeton. Washington wanted to continue the attack, but wisely he decided his exhausted men had given all they could. His army went into winter quarters at Morristown.</para>
<para id="fs-idm392678352">The Battles of Trenton and Princeton demonstrated Americans‚Äô resolve. Equally important, these significant victories revived fading spirits. The Continental Army survived.</para>
