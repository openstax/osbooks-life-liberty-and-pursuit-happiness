<para id="fs-idm396656000">The main ideas of the cartoon can be gleaned from the notes provided in the introduction and in the answer key for this activity. Several of the speech bubbles on the cartoon are in French, illegible, and/or unnecessary for student analysis of main ideas. A detailed description of the dialogue and captions in this image can be found on the British Museum’s website here: <link url="https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1466787&amp;partId=1&amp;people=102891&amp;peoA=102891-2-60&amp;page=4">https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1466787&amp;partId=1&amp;people=102891&amp;peoA=102891-2-60&amp;page=4</link>. After discussing the details of the print with them, have students write their own speech bubbles for each of the figures. Because the image is so detailed, it would be useful to enlarge significantly when projected.</para>

<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm400499200">The French Revolution posed one of the first great foreign policy challenges for the United States. As John Adams’s administration began in 1797, the French were already at war with most European powers, including Great Britain. Anxious to follow Washington’s example and maintain neutrality, Adams dispatched a delegation to France to negotiate with the French government to stop the French seizure of U.S. merchant ships. This delegation was the subject of this 1798 satirical print entitled “Property protected--à la Françoise” (meaning “in or according to the French manner”) by British artist Charles Williams. In the print, America is represented as a woman wearing a feathered headdress. The two men wearing feathered hats and cloaks on either side of America represent the directors of the French government. The three figures surrounding the large, treasure-laden “National Sack” wear the tricolored cockade or badge of the French Revolution on their hats. The two standing Frenchmen each hold a sack labeled “Extorted from Portugal” (left) and “Borrow’d pr [per] Force from Switzerland.” Across the English Channel, John Bull laughs at the scene atop “Shakespeare’s Cliff.” Look carefully at the cartoon for several minutes before answering the questions that follow.</para>
