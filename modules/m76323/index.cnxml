<para id="fs-idm413432112">In the summer of 1630, a fleet of eleven ships bearing more than one thousand settlers landed in Massachusetts. The new arrivals were Puritans whose governor, John Winthrop, preached a sermon in which he announced that their errand was to establish a ‚Äúcity upon a hill‚Äù to serve as an example of a purified church and godly society. The Puritans believed the survival of the Massachusetts Bay Colony depended upon a common vision and unity based upon their mutual <term>covenant.</term></para>
<para id="fs-idm417042080">Puritan theology was rooted in a belief in predestination‚Äîthe idea that God, from the beginning of time, had determined who would be saved in heaven and who damned in hell. Individuals‚Äô future status in the afterlife thus did not depend on their actions on earth, though it did manifest itself during the course of their lives. The Puritans believed that individuals who were among ‚Äúthe Elect,‚Äù the saved, underwent a conversion experience in which they sensed an overpowering feeling of salvation. Members of the Elect showed outward signs of God‚Äôs grace in moral and upright behavior that demonstrated they were ‚ÄúVisible Saints.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm410526960">Men and women were members of the Elect. Women could not be ministers or hold other positions of leadership, although they could hold spiritual meetings in their homes. They gathered in small groups to pray, read the Bible, and review sermons from Sunday services and Thursday lectures (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_02_03_PilgChurch"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm410355584">In 1634, Anne and William Hutchinson moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony with their several children. William was a wealthy textile merchant who served in several government and church positions. Anne was the daughter of a Puritan clergyman who had run afoul of the authorities of the Church of England and was arrested for his dissenting views. Nevertheless, her father had educated Anne and instructed her thoroughly in scripture and theology. She was a follower of the controversial minister Reverend John Cotton, who had migrated to Massachusetts Bay and started the First Congregational Church. Anne Hutchinson soon became known as an outspoken troublemaker who frequently challenged authority (though otherwise conformed to social expectations as a woman and mother).</para>
<para id="fs-idm409100192">As was common in the colony, Hutchinson began to hold meetings for women in her home. At first, small gatherings of five or six women assembled at her house; however, she was soon hosting two meetings per week for large groups of more than sixty women and men. Participants listened raptly as she spoke from her chair, providing scriptural analysis and commentary on the sermons of the ministers. Women could repeat the content of sermons but were not supposed to comment on them, especially for men. Like Reverend Cotton, however, Hutchinson began to criticize the idea of ‚Äúvisible sainthood‚Äù as constituting a doctrine of ‚Äúgood works,‚Äù which resembled what Puritans thought was a corruption of the Catholic Church. She insisted upon a covenant of grace instead, in which individuals were justified by their faith alone. She even walked out of several Sunday services to express her displeasure with differing religious ideas preached from the pulpit. In some ways, her Puritan theology was even more strict than that of the other Puritans of the colony.</para>
<para id="fs-idm410345296">In the summer of 1637, the General Court ordered Hutchinson to stop holding meetings. The government and church authorities thought women should neither teach men nor criticize ministers, because it upset the patriarchal structure of Puritan society in which men ruled families, churches, and government. Their overriding goal was social harmony and obedience to a prescribed set of ideas. Nevertheless, Hutchinson persisted because she felt a duty to attend to her fellow Puritans‚Äô spiritual needs and to discuss biblical and doctrinal truths with them.</para>
<para id="fs-idm406547776">By November, however, the authorities had had enough of Hutchinson‚Äôs public opinions and defiance. At age forty-six years and pregnant, she was arrested and put on trial for <term>sedition</term> before Governor John Winthrop and forty other deputies of the court. As the proceedings opened, Winthrop read the charges against Hutchinson: She had seditiously criticized the ministers and taught <term>heretical</term> religious views contrary to common opinion. Her views were dangerous to the colony because they threatened to ‚Äúseduce many honest persons‚Äù and spread heresy that would destroy the common good. The governor thought this especially perilous because Hutchinson was a woman. As Winthrop pointed out to her directly, expressing these views was ‚Äúa thing not tolerable nor comely in the sight of God nor fitting for your sex.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm410379104">Hutchinson was intelligent, quick-witted, and profoundly knowledgeable about scripture. She ably and courageously defended herself against the charges of the mostly hostile panel of judges and challenged them to point out specifically how she had violated the law or scripture with her views. ‚ÄúI am called here to answer before you,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut I hear no things laid to my charge.‚Äù When Winthrop asked why she held her weekly meetings, she vehemently replied, ‚ÄúIt is lawful for me to do so.‚Äù When he asked whether it was appropriate for her to teach men, she wryly responded, ‚ÄúWhy do you call me to teach the court?‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm412939856">In making its case against her, the court called six ministers to testify about Hutchinson‚Äôs preaching. These men noted that she was ‚Äúnot only difficult in her opinions, but also of an intemperate spirit.‚Äù Hutchinson withstood the inquiry, answering questions boldly and honestly. Two days into the trial, she openly claimed to have learned God‚Äôs will through an immediate revelation. Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley scoffed, ‚ÄúHow! An immediate revelation.‚Äù Hutchinson replied without hesitation, ‚ÄúBy the voice of His own spirit to my soul.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm404331152">With those words, her fate in the colony was sealed. The ministers would not accept this challenge to their spiritual authority, especially from a woman. They did not accept the claim that a person could experience an immediate divine revelation. Expecting the worst, Hutchinson vowed, ‚ÄúNow if you do condemn me for speaking what in my conscience I know to be truth, I must commit myself unto the Lord.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm409103552">After several days of testimony, Winthrop issued the court‚Äôs verdict. ‚ÄúThe court,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhath already declared themselves satisfied concerning the things you hear, and concerning the troublesomeness of her spirit and the danger of her course amongst us, which is not to be suffered.‚Äù Hutchinson was convicted of sedition and heresy and sentenced to be jailed and then banished from the colony as a woman ‚Äúunfit for our society‚Äù the following spring. Because of the idea of a covenant that bound New England society together religiously, politically, and socially, the community could not keep an unrepentant heretic among them or they would be punished collectively by God. When Hutchinson demanded, ‚Äú[Why] I am banished?‚Äù Winthrop replied, ‚ÄúSay no more. The court knows [why] and is satisfied.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm413281344">Hutchinson was also excommunicated from the church. The next year, 1638, she, her husband, their fourteen children, and sixty of her followers moved to the island of Aquidnick (Rhode Island), a haven for religious dissenters. In 1642, after the death of her husband, Hutchinson and her youngest children moved to the Dutch colony of New Netherlands (New York). The Siwanoy Indians on Long Island launched a retaliatory raid against several outlying settlements there a year later and killed Hutchinson and all but one of her children.</para>
<para id="fs-idm413068128">Although some interpreters paint Hutchinson as a victim of Puritan repression or a hero of modern feminism, the truth is more complex. A woman who risked everything for the courage of her convictions, she was silenced pushing the boundaries of patriarchy. Yet, she was also uncompromising in her orthodox religious beliefs and held views that challenged the unity of the fledgling colony. The banishment of Anne Hutchinson revealed many tensions within Puritan society.</para>
