<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm624957888">From 1955 to 1995, the Democratic Party held a continuous majority in the House of Representatives. During this time, the federal government grew substantially, leading some critics to argue it was becoming more and more out of touch with the people it was designed to represent. In the lead-up to the 1994 election, Republican congressmen Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey wrote the “Contract with America” to outline the policy actions their party would take if they gained a majority in the House. All but two sitting Republicans in the House and all nonincumbent Republican candidates signed the statement. The document proved to be a persuasive piece of campaign propaganda: In November of that year, the Republicans made huge gains in Congress and took control of the House of Representatives.</para>
