<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm369851296">Born into slavery in New York state, Sojourner Truth escaped in 1826 and devoted much of the rest of her life to championing the causes of abolition and women’s rights. On May 29, 1851, Truth stood before the crowd at the Women’s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, and delivered a stirring speech. In the months and years that followed, that speech was transcribed by several abolitionists. Ultimately, it came to be titled “Ain’t I a Woman.” Truth never learned to read and write, which makes her leadership all the more remarkable. One of the most famous transcriptions of this speech was published in an 1851 edition of the <emphasis effect="italics">Anti-Slavery Bugle</emphasis> by Reverend Marius Robinson, an Ohio abolitionist who had worked with Truth. Another was published in an 1863 edition of the <emphasis effect="italics">Anti-Slavery Standard</emphasis> by Frances Dana Gage, an abolitionist and feminist who presided over the convention at which Truth spoke. Gage’s transcription accounts for Sojourner Truth’s accent: because Truth was enslaved by Dutch settlers in upstate New York, she spoke with a Dutch accent. Robinson’s account fails to convey this.</para>

I want to say a few words about this matter. I am a woman’s rights. <link target-id="fs-idm393077520">I have as much muscle as any man, and can do as much work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed, and can any man do more than that? I have heard much about the sexes being equal; I can carry as much as any man, and can eat as much too, if I can get it. I am as strong as any man that is now.</link> As for intellect, all I can say is, if woman have a pint and man a quart, why can’t she have her little pint full? You need not be afraid to give us our rights for fear we will take too much, for we can’t take more than our pint’ll hold. The poor men seem to be all in confusion, and don’t know what to do. Why children, if you have woman’s rights give it to her and you will feel better. You will have your own rights, and they won’t be so much trouble.</entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left"><link target-id="fs-idm319966992">I can’t read, but I can hear.</link> I have heard the bible and have learned that Eve caused man to sin. Well if woman upset the world, do give her a chance to set it right side up again. <link target-id="fs-idm322398240">The Lady has spoken about Jesus, how he never spurned woman from him, and she was right. When Lazarus died, Mary and Martha came to him with faith and love and besought him to raise their brother. And Jesus wept—and Lazarus came forth. And how came Jesus into the world? Through God who created him and woman who bore him.</link> Man, where is your part? But the women are coming up blessed be God and a few of the men are coming up with them. But man is in a tight place, the poor slave is on him, woman is coming on him, and he is surely between a hawk and a buzzard.</entry>

Nobody eber helps me into carriages, or ober mud-puddles, or gibs me any best place!”</link> And raising herself to her full height, and her voice to a pitch like rolling thunder, she asked, “And ain’t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! (and she bared her right arm to the shoulder, showing her tremendous muscular power). I have ploughed, and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain’t I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man—when I could get it—and bear de lash as well! And ain’t I a woman? I have borne thirteen chilern, and seen ‘em mos’ all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother’s grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain’t I a woman?” . . .</entry>
