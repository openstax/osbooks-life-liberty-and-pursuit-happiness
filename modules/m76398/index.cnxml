Later DBQs will provide more documents with the option for teachers to include targeted questions as best fits their teaching situation.</para>

<title>I. Warm-up Activity (10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm401279008">Distribute <emphasis effect="bold">Handout A: Benjamin Franklin: The First American?</emphasis> Have students indicate if they would be pleased or not pleased with each scenario on their handout. Ask for volunteers to justify their responses.</para>
<list id="fs-idm354886400" list-type="bulleted">
<item>Step 1: You are twelve years old, and you love to read. However, books are very expensive and difficult to find where you live, so your father signs you up for an apprenticeship in a business that will give you much better access to books, newspapers, and magazines.</item>
<item>Step 2: You will receive free room and board in your new job, and you will live with your boss.</item>
<item>Step 3: You are committed by contract to work in this job for nine years.</item>
<item>Step 4: Although your boss will cover all your expenses for the term of the contract, you will only receive wages for the ninth year. In return, you will receive training so that you will be able to start your own business.</item>
<item>Step 5: The boss is your older brother.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm410277520">After students have responded to the question for each of these steps, ask which of them, if anyone, would be pleased upon learning about the entire scenario? Conduct a brief discussion in which you ask those who were willing to take the job in step 1, but were no longer interested after step 5, at which step they would have declined the opportunity. Then, explain that these are the terms of apprenticeship in which Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs father arranged for him to work in the printing shop of his older brother, James, in 1718. Note also that these were considered generous terms for an apprentice at the time, and most working-class boys were expected to begin an apprenticeship to learn a trade in this manner by the time they were fourteen years old.</para>
