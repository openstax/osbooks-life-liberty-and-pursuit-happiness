<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm246254688">The women’s rights movement grew significantly over the course of the nineteenth century as women fought to secure an equal place in society alongside men. Sarah Grimké was born on a South Carolina plantation in 1792 but grew to despise slavery. Sarah and her sister, Angelina, became the first prominent female voices in favor of abolitionism and traveled throughout the country giving speeches and lectures against slavery. Male abolitionists immediately condemned Sarah and Angelina for stepping outside of a traditional domestic role, leading the sisters to also begin to fight for a political voice for women. Sarah wrote multiple letters to Mary Parker, the president of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, in 1837. In the following letter, she discussed the legal inequalities that women faced in American society.</para>

Woman has no political existence. With the single exception of presenting a petition to the legislative body, she is a <emphasis effect="bold">cipher</emphasis> in the nation; or, if not actually so in representative governments, <link target-id="fs-idm294760464">she is only counted, like the slaves of the South, to swell the number of law-makers who form decrees for her government, with little reference to her benefit, except so far as her good may promote their own</link>. . . .<newline/><emphasis effect="italics">“By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being, or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband under whose wing, protection and cover she performs everything. . . . ”</emphasis></entry>

All contracts made with her, like those made with slaves by their owners, are a mere <emphasis effect="bold">nullity</emphasis></link>. Our kind defenders have legislated away almost all of our legal rights, and in the true spirit of such injustice and oppression, have kept us in ignorance of those very laws by which we are governed. <link target-id="fs-idm174153280">They have persuaded us, that we have no right to investigate the laws, and that, if we did, we could not comprehend them. . . .</link><newline/><emphasis effect="italics">“The husband, by the old law, might give his wife moderate correction, as he is to answer for her misbehavior. The law thought it reasonable to entrust him with this power of restraining her by domestic chastisement. The courts of law will still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty, in case of any gross misbehavior.”</emphasis></entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">The various laws which I have <emphasis effect="bold">transcribed</emphasis>, leave women very little more liberty, or power, in some respects, than the slave. “A slave,” says the civil code of Louisiana, “is one who is in the power of a master, to whom he belongs. He can possess nothing, nor acquire anything, but what must belong to his master.” I do not wish by any means to <emphasis effect="bold">intimate</emphasis> that the condition of free women can be compared to that of slaves in suffering, or in degradation; still, I believe the laws which deprive married women of their rights and privileges, have a tendency to lessen them in their own estimation as moral and responsible beings, <link target-id="fs-idm163927344">and that their being made by civil law inferior to their husbands, has a <emphasis effect="bold">debasing</emphasis> and mischievous effect upon them, teaching them practically the fatal lesson to look unto man for protection and <emphasis effect="bold">indulgence</emphasis></link>. . . .<newline/>Thine in the bonds of womanhood,<newline/>Sarah M. Grimké</entry>
