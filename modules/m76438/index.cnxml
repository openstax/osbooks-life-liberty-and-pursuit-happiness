<para id="fs-idm397929376">July 4, Independence Day, has been the United States’ chief civic holiday since the American Revolution. The Founders, chief among them General George Washington and the leaders of the <term>Continental Congress</term>, have grown grander in our memory in the intervening time since 1776. Yet they did not rush into immortality. Far from it.</para>
<para id="fs-idm396638848">By sundown on April 19, 1775, Britain’s appointed Governor of Massachusetts, General Thomas Gage, retained authority only over greater Boston. Earlier that day, his troops had arrived in Lexington, but not before colonial riders had warned John Hancock and Samuel Adams “The Redcoats are coming!” Instead of arresting the rebels, proceeding to Concord to seize the colonial store of gunpowder, and returning to the capital having struck a mighty blow against colonial resistance, Gage’s men had kicked a hornet’s nest. By sundown, all Massachusetts beyond Boston was in open revolt. Hancock and Adams had new moral authority thanks to Gage’s botched attempt to have them arrested—probably for transportation to treason trials in England. Their triumphant progress to Philadelphia for the <term>Second Continental Congress</term> was marked by military escorts and celebratory dinners at every stage: Gage had made them into continental heroes.</para>
<para id="fs-idm387585632">Congress responded by naming Virginian George Washington commander in chief of the newly christened Continental Army (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_03_04_Commander"/>). Samuel Adams’ cousin John, another Massachusetts congressman, had his way in choosing Washington and did so because of Washington’s considerable military experience and because he was a southerner who would bring geographical balance to the New England army outside Boston. Washington’s character and military bearing were also beyond reproach.</para>

<para id="fs-idm399674272">Radical John Adams wanted the colonists to declare their independence immediately, in part because he knew diplomatic recognition of a new nation would add weight to its cause. Soon enough, French agents replied to American feelers by saying that yes, King Louis XVI would aid the rebels—under the table. On the cheap. A little bit. If the thirteen colonies declared independence, on the other hand, His Most Christian Majesty would happily and publicly lend his aid. Yet one year, two months, and nineteen days elapsed between the Battles of Lexington and Concord and promulgation of the Declaration of Independence. With the British government making war on colonists up and down the Atlantic coast of North America, the time lag requires some explanation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm397287248">There were several reasons why what seems to be the obvious course was not taken right away, despite the increasingly vociferous demands of radical congressmen like John Adams. First, North American colonists generally had been loyal Britons. In fact, they were never so patriotically British as in 1763, the year the French and Indian War ended. Britain emerged from that conflict as the greatest European power, and mighty France was reduced to runner-up in the contest for international power. Britons were freer than other Europeans, they were more prosperous, they were Protestant, and they were more powerful. The colonists considered themselves loyal subjects of the king. Why would anyone want to leave that situation?</para>
<para id="fs-idm391981792">As the chief beneficiaries of the victory of 1763, the colonists also had greater reason for contentment than anyone else in the Empire. Their colonial governmental systems, with local legislation mainly by colonial assemblies under a general system of legislation by Parliament, taxed them less than Englishmen were taxed, were more representative than the British government in the Home Islands, and did not even require them to pay a fair share of the cost of the mighty military establishment that had driven the French off the colonists’ continent. Yes, this same line of reasoning had led Parliament to endeavor, with the Stamp Act taxes of 1764–1775, to pass on some of the burden of maintaining troops to defend the colonies. Yet even if they had paid all the taxes Parliament enacted, the colonists still would have been paying only 10 percent of the cost of their own defense.</para>
<para id="fs-idm389221312">In short, being in the British Empire was a sweet deal for the colonies—and not only geostrategically. In the era of <term>mercantilism,</term> it was also highly advantageous economically. Great Britain had a huge colonial empire all over the world, and the general rule was that only people within the Empire could trade with any part of the Empire. The colonists’ chief market was a highly lucrative trade with Great Britain and her colonies in the Caribbean. Leaving the British Empire would mean disrupting long-standing business relationships, followed by an uncertain future. It would also mean the loss of protection by the powerful Royal Navy (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_03_04_RoyalNavy"/>).</para>

<caption>The Royal Navy was unrivaled in its might in the late eighteenth century.

Royal George</emphasis>, a 100-gun first-rate ship of the line.</caption>

<para id="fs-idm399582352">Perhaps equally importantly, although there were significant numbers of Germans in Pennsylvania and Dutchmen in New York, most white inhabitants of the colonies were British. This is why, even years after independence was declared, prominent revolutionaries such as New York’s John Jay and Virginia’s Edmund Pendleton could still think of the rupture as “unnatural.” The Declaration itself included a poignant paragraph drawing British attention to the fact that the colonists had repeatedly over many years appealed to their “British brethren,” their “common kindred,” to intercede with the British government on their behalf. Yet, Britons had proven “deaf to the voice of … consanguinity.” Only “necessity” impelled the colonists to declare independence in the face of this consideration.</para>
<para id="fs-idm387778400">Another reason independence was not declared before July 4, 1776, is that the colonists commonly understood their quarrel to be with Parliament, not with King George III. As Thomas Jefferson explained in “A Summary View of the Rights of British America” (1774), the colonists saw George III as their rightful king, with authority to exercise certain government powers on their behalf, but they thought the British Parliament was “foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws.”</para>
<para id="fs-idm401197392">Although the power had been unused since the time of Queen Anne, the British Crown still had the option to use a veto to stymie Parliament’s initiatives to intervene in colonial governance. So the colonists devoted their attention to rousing George III to come to their aid. His failure to do so, they finally concluded, marked him as a tyrant. Ironically, from where George III sat, it would have been tyrannical for him to claim wide-ranging authority in North America over Parliament’s will (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_03_04_GeorgeIII"/>). Britons found colonial calls for George III to intervene in the lawmaking process on colonists’ behalf very strange, even ridiculous. The idea that Parliament was the problem and the king the potential solution had long bedazzled the colonists, however.</para>

<caption>King George III had ruled Great Britain and its Empire for fifteen years by the time he went before Parliament in 1775 and declared the American colonies in rebellion. Johann Zoffany painted this portrait of the 33-year-old king in 1771.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm407620496">Finally, and perhaps most obviously, fear held the colonists back. After all, by proclamation in August 1775, George III had declared participants in armed resistance to be rebels, and the prospect of all-out war with Britain was frightening. There seemed a very good likelihood that the colonists would lose a war with the world’s greatest power. In that event, Patriot leaders likely would all be hanged, and the colonies’ virtually republican political systems almost certainly would be transformed into something far less congenial.</para>
<para id="fs-idm396507312">On the other hand, they might win a war for independence. That prospect was frightening too. To win a war required an army. An army would have officers and, yet more worrisome, a victorious general. In Europe at that time—in the world at virtually any time—a victorious general and his officers seized power and took over the government. Britain’s monarchy and lords traced their origins directly to just such a sequence of events in 1066, and everyone knew it. No one knew that George Washington would be George Washington. It had been millennia since a man had been given ultimate executive authority and had given it back.</para>
<para id="fs-idm391920192">The last holdouts to declaring independence, the central colonies, came around only slowly. When Virginia’s Richard Henry Lee rose in the Second Continental Congress on June 7, 1776, to move that Congress declare “That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States,” delegates from New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey had not yet been authorized to vote for independence. Thus, Congress voted to put off a decision on independence until early July.</para>
<para id="fs-idm391597536">Military affairs were urgent by the time Congress came to voting on July 2: A huge British naval force had assembled near New York City, and another flotilla approached South Carolina. Still, the New York delegation had to put off voting until it received new instructions. Twelve states voted for independence on July 2 (South Carolina did so only for the sake of unanimity), and New York’s congressmen added their state to the roster the next week.</para>
<para id="fs-idm389703520">Independence was no foregone conclusion on July 2, 1776. The American colonists only reluctantly embraced independence even after more than a year of war. They had close historical, cultural, economic, and political ties to Great Britain that were not easily broken. After a decade of perceived tyranny and war, they finally decided on a permanent split from their motherland. On that date, the Continental Congress formally passed Richard Henry’s Lee resolution for independence. On July 4, the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence.</para>
