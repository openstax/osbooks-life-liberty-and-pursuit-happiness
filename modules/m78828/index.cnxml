<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm234472048">Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson frequently disagreed about matters relating to national policy. Washington looked to Hamilton’s economic initiatives for the funding of the national debt, the assumption of states’ debts, an excise tax, and the chartering of a national bank as the best course of action for the young nation’s financial and trade future. As secretary of state, Jefferson was tasked with giving firm direction to American foreign policy, though Hamilton frequently interjected his own views into foreign policy debates, a fact that did not endear him to Jefferson. It is important to remember that despite their differences, both men contributed greatly to Washington’s first cabinet and played a major role in directing the course of the young republic under the new Constitution.</para>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Report on a National Bank , December 13, 1790<newline/>
Public Banks have found admission and patronage among the principal and most enlightened commercial nations. They have successively obtained in Italy, Germany, Holland, England and France. . . .<newline/>
Trade and industry, wherever they have been tried, have been indebted to them for important aid. And Government has been repeatedly under the greatest obligations to them.</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Opinion on the Constitutionality of the Establishing a National Bank, February 15, 1791<newline/>
I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground: That “all powers not delegated to the United States, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States or to the people. . . .<newline/>
The incorporation of a bank, and the powers assumed by this bill, have not, in my opinion, been delegated to the United States, by the Constitution. . . .<newline/>
<link target-id="fs-idm260210832">To erect a bank, and to regulate commerce, are very different acts.</link></entry>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Opinion on the Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States, February 23, 1791<newline/>
It is conceded that implied powers are to be considered as delegated equally with express ones. Then it follows, that as a power of erecting a corporation [such as a bank] may as well be implied as any other thing . . . because it is the province of the federal government to regulate those objects [trade], and because it is incident to a general sovereign or legislative power to regulate a thing, to employ all the means which relate to its regulation to be best and greatest advantage.</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Letter to George Washington, May 23, 1792<newline/>
That this corrupt squadron, deciding the voice of the legislature, have manifested their dispositions to get rid of the limitations imposed by the constitution on the general legislature, limitations, on the faith of which, the states acceded to that instrument.</entry>

The embarrassments, which have obstructed the progress of our external trade, have led to serious reflections on the necessity of enlarging the sphere of our domestic commerce. . . .<newline/>
To secure such a market, there is no other expedient, than to promote manufacturing establishments. Manufacturers who constitute the most numerous class, after the Cultivators, of land, are for that reason the principal consumers of the surplus of their labour. . . .<newline/>
It has been maintained, that Agriculture is, not only, the most productive, but the only productive species of industry. The reality of this suggestion has . . . not been verified by any accurate detail of facts and calculation. . . .<newline/>
<link target-id="fs-idm244704384">The spirit of enterprise, useful and prolific as it is, must necessarily be contracted or expanded</link> in proportion to the simplicity or variety of the occupations and productions, which are to be found in a Society. It must be less in a nation of cultivators, than in a nation of cultivators . . . and merchants.</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left"><emphasis effect="italics">Notes on the State of Virginia</emphasis>, 1785<newline/>
Those who labour in the earth are the chosen people of God, if ever he had he had a chosen people. . . . While we have land to labour then, let us never wish to see our citizens occupied at a work-bench, or twirling a distaff. Carpenters, masons, smiths, are wanting in husbandry: but, for the general operations of manufacture, let our work-shops remain in Europe. . . . <link target-id="fs-idm265286528">The mobs of great cities add just so much to the support of pure government, as sores do to the strength of the human body.</link></entry>

The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral.</entry>
<entry valign="top" align="left">Letter to George Mason, February 4, 1791<newline/>

<entry valign="top" align="left">Letter to William Short, January 3, 1793<newline/>
My own affections have been deeply wounded by some of the martyrs to this cause, but rather than it should have failed, I would have seen half the earth desolated. Were there but an Adam and an Eve left in every country, and left free, it would be better than as it now is.</entry>
