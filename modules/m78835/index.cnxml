<title>Suggested Sequencing</title>
<para id="fs-idm400673008">Students should have a solid foundation of the regional differences in the former colonies, now states, as well as an understanding of the ratification of the Constitution. This Lesson is best used after students have read <link class="target-chapter" document="m76411">The Constitutional Convention</link> and <link class="target-chapter" document="m76412">The Ratification Debate on the Constitution</link> Narratives in Chapter 3. The <link class="target-chapter" document="m78813">James Madison and the Bill of Rights</link> Narrative in Chapter 4 can be used as background for the Lesson or can be assigned as homework after the Lesson to reinforce main ideas.</para>

<title>I. Warm-up Activity (5‚Äì10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm412079728">1. Ask students to consider a time when they had to work with a group in which they did not agree on something. How did they resolve their differences? Guide discussion toward the idea of compromise and the role of compromising in trying to move toward a goal.</para>
<para id="fs-idm401136528">2. Ask students to recall how the creation and ratification of the Constitution provide several examples of compromise and group work. If students struggle to answer, play the <link url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgRWoKKFrd8&amp;index=10&amp;list=PLBjemLhDhcNE_9Nin-SQKIjNG6qpv-gfj&amp;t=0s">BRI Homework Help</link> video (5 minutes) on the Constitution, which reviews delegates compromising on creating a bicameral legislature, on how to count slaves in determining representation, and on the need for a Bill of Rights.</para>

<title>II. Exploration (20 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm396697536">1. Distribute <emphasis>Handout A: Refining the Bill of Rights: Madison‚Äôs Proposals</emphasis>, and have students move into thirteen small groups.</para>
<para id="fs-idm400156176">2. Students will discuss each of Madison‚Äôs proposals listed in Column A and write each in their own words in Column B.</para>
<para id="fs-idm377080704">3. After discussion, each student may decide to write their individual paraphrase or write a group paraphrase.</para>

<section id="fs-idm361941072">
<title>III. Application (30‚Äì40 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm381311840">1. At this point, designate each of the groups to be the delegation from a specific state: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia. Point out that the sixty-five representatives were not equally apportioned among the states, but that more populous states like Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts had larger delegations, and Delaware and Rhode Island each had only one representative.</para>
<para id="fs-idm398070240">2. Once students have been assigned their delegation, have them brainstorm what would be important to their state to consider in the amendment process. Ask students to consider the knowledge of the different economies and patterns of settlement in the colonies from previous chapters.</para>
<para id="fs-idm399547696">3. Students will discuss the merits of each excerpt in Column A of their chart, in light of their responsibility to faithfully represent their constituents from their assigned delegation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm400980784">4. Students will then record a check in Column C for each amendment they would support, assuming the identity of a member of their assigned delegation. Students within a state delegation may or may not come to a unanimous decision, but they should come to a majority decision. Have each group select one person in the delegation to act as a spokesperson for the vote.</para>
<para id="fs-idm376330304">5. Call for a final vote on each proposed amendment. Each state spokesperson will vote for their delegation and should be prepared to briefly share the reasoning for their response.</para>

<title>IV. Conclusion and Assessment (5‚Äì15 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm376961248">1. Have students work with their small groups and pocket Constitutions to complete Column D and answer the analysis questions that follow. Lead a discussion on the analysis questions or collect them, as best suits your classroom.</para>
