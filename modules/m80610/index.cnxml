<para id="fs-idm363958976">Use this Narrative to give students a greater understanding of cowboy culture and the roles cowboys and ranchers played in the economic and environmental transformation of the West.</para>
</note>
<para id="fs-idm350633744">The cowboy is at once the most familiar, beloved, and mythologized symbol of the North American West. Images of a man on horseback, Stetson on his head and six-gun on his hip, have been branded on our collective memory by generations of artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians, advertisers, and other purveyors of popular culture. From Buffalo Bill to the Lone Ranger, cowboys are widely seen as the embodiment of core American values‚Äîfreedom, honesty, individualism, opportunity, self-sufficiency‚Äîas well as the model of American masculinity. Representations of the classic cowboy are always male, always white, and always on the side of what is right and good.</para>
<para id="fs-idm489664128">The historical truth, of course, is considerably more complicated and often less romantic than the legends we associate with the ‚ÄúCattle Kingdom‚Äù of the late nineteenth century. The heyday of open-range ranching and long trail drives lasted only about 20 years, and the cowboys of this period were generally wage workers rather than independent cattlemen. They were also a more diverse lot than we imagine, including men of many different races and ethnicities, as well as some women. Their lives and labor, though not usually as exciting as a western movie, played a significant role in the economic and environmental transformation of the western United States.</para>
<para id="fs-idm308514672">Cowboys did not gallop suddenly into the American landscape and then just as suddenly ride off into the sunset. Spanish settlers first introduced both cattle and horse-mounted <emphasis effect="italics">vaqueros</emphasis> to the Southwest during the seventeenth century (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_09_03_Cowboy"/>). By the early 1800s, several million cattle roamed the range from California to Texas, tended by Hispanic herders whose language contributed many words to the vocabulary of modern ranching, including bronco, chaparajos or ‚Äúchaps,‚Äù corral, lariat, lasso, rodeo, and rancho. Anglo-American immigrants to the region adopted these traditions along with the hardy Texas longhorns that became a staple of the cattle industry after the Civil War. That conflict temporarily disrupted the market for Texas beef that had developed by 1850, but the market boomed again with the postwar expansion of railroads across the Great Plains and the explosive growth of eastern cities.</para>

<caption>Many of the tools and practices used by North American cowboys, including the use of horses, were derived from methods that Spanish-speaking <emphasis effect="italics">vaqueros</emphasis> had used since the 1500s.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm352630496">Long-distance cattle drives to bring animals to market developed in response to a combination of economic and ecological factors. After the war, competing railways established depots in Kansas to attract the business of cattle ranchers who had previously taken their stock to Louisiana or Missouri. These railheads had to be established to the west of more densely populated farming regions, because longhorns carried a tick that transmitted <term>splenic fever</term> (commonly called Texas or Spanish fever), which ravaged other breeds of cattle; thus, several states were encouraged to ban longhorn cattle or establish quarantine zones. The first cattle town, Abilene, lay beyond the line that Kansas drew to keep longhorns away from settled areas. Connected to eastern markets by the Kansas Pacific Railroad, Abilene shipped out millions of longhorns that had been driven north on the Chisholm Trail. The Santa Fe Railroad soon established competing railheads at Wichita and Dodge City, the destination for herds moving along the Western Trail from central Texas. Later drives took cattle up the vast Goodnight-Loving Trail as far as Denver, Colorado, and Cheyenne, Wyoming.</para>
<para id="fs-idm327423760">Such lengthy trips were feasible because semi-wild longhorns endured them well and fetched high prices at the stockyard despite their lean, tough meat. Steers bought for $10 a head or less in Texas could be sold for $25 or more at a railhead in Kansas. The cattle towns, in turn, could make money selling supplies, alcohol, and sexual companionship to the cowboys who congregated there at the end of the drive.</para>
<para id="fs-idm326366256">Herding cattle on these trails entailed a lot of drudgery, discomfort, occasional danger, and huge amounts of dust. On a typical drive, a crew of only 10 to 15 drovers would be responsible for moving approximately 2,000 steers and 100 to 150 horses across hundreds of miles of open prairie in all kinds of weather. For their trouble, they received $40 a month and a steady diet of beans, biscuits, hard cheese, and coffee from the <term>chuckwagon</term>. Stampedes, Indians, and <term>rustlers</term> created the occasional thrill, but gunfights were rare and gunshot wounds usually accidental.</para>
<para id="fs-idm373309888">What cowboys most often battled were boredom, fatigue, and nature. Dust from trampling hooves coated men as ‚Äúthick as fur,‚Äù except when heavy rains transformed the trail into a mass of sticky mud. Despite the bandanas that shielded their faces, cowboys could cough up dirty phlegm for weeks after a drive. Hours in the saddle each day caused blisters and back problems, aggravated by nights of sleeping on the ground in the cold and damp. To pass the time, cowboys told raunchy jokes, held ‚Äústag dances,‚Äù and sang about the miseries of life on the trail. Some also took out their frustrations on the animals they rode and tended, pushing horses and cattle to the limits of their endurance and punishing them cruelly if they balked.</para>
<para id="fs-idm360632624">Racial diversity and discrimination were also regular features of cowboy culture. Of the approximately 35,000 men who pursued that occupation between 1867 and 1887, the majority claimed Euro-American ancestry and came from Louisiana or Texas, where prejudice against African Americans and Mexican Americans ran deep. Trail bosses often hired black and Hispanic hands, however, because they did the same work, or better, for lower wages than whites would. Mexican <emphasis effect="italics">vaqueros</emphasis>, in particular, had a well-deserved reputation for being excellent riders and ropers. American Indians also joined cattle drives, especially on the trails through Indian Territory, and at least one cattleman praised his Pawnee wranglers as ‚Äúthe best in the world.‚Äù</para>
<para id="fs-idm334991104">By some estimates, as many as a quarter to a third of all drovers in this period were African American, Mexican American, or American Indian. Few of them rose to the level of trail boss or ranch owner, due to entrenched racism that held them back even when they possessed superior skills. Yet to former slaves such as Nat Love, life on the open range offered a degree of freedom unknown to black sharecroppers at the time (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_09_03_Cowboys"/>). Similarly, some Indians preferred herding cattle to scratching out a scant existence as farmers on poor reservation lands. Many others subsisted on rations of government-issued beef that had been purchased on contract from cattle herders.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm496415136">By 1880, with the Indian Wars ending and the bison nearing extinction, the focus of the Cattle Kingdom shifted to the northern plains. Instead of taking herds to Kansas, cowboys increasingly drove them to Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas, where cattle companies hoped to fatten improved breeds on the free grass of the public domain. Low costs and high prices promised dependable profits of 40 percent annually, encouraging a stampede to cover every acre of the former ‚Äúbuffalo commons‚Äù with cows. In 1885, an estimated 7.5 million cattle roamed the prairies north of New Mexico and Texas, with some areas containing four times as many animals as the range could support. Overstocking produced severe overgrazing, which wrecked native grasslands and weakened cattle, but no one cared much about conservation.</para>
<para id="fs-idm348291520">Disaster struck in 1886 and 1887, when a vicious cycle of summer droughts and bitter winters caused massive losses across the Great Plains. In the northern region, the cattle mortality rate approached 90 percent, and rotting carcasses piled high along the trails and fences. The Big Die-Up, as it was known, graphically illustrated the ‚Äútragedy of the commons,‚Äù which is the idea that people acting independently in their own self-interest negatively affect the common good by depleting or spoiling a resource through their actions, and the failure of the western ranching industry to regulate itself to safeguard resources for sustainable use in the future. As one newspaper lamented, ‚Äúrange husbandry is over, is ruined, destroyed, and it may have been by the insatiable greed of its followers.‚Äù The scientific management of resources in the West later became a core conservationist goal during President Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs administration.</para>
<para id="fs-idm373264368">In fact, the western ranching industry did not die out but rather changed with the times. After 1887, cowboys continued to tend vast herds on the public domain, and railroads continued to supply the increasingly mechanized slaughterhouses of Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago. From there, western beef traveled in refrigerated railroad cars to feed the growing populations of industrial cities all over the Midwest and East Coast. As the Great Plains filled with homesteaders, though, large cattle companies grudgingly gave way to family-owned ranches that raised higher-quality beef on fewer acres.</para>
<para id="fs-idm309001136">There was still conflict over access to the open range, including the infamous Johnson County War of 1892, which pitted big <term>stockmen</term> against <term>sodbusters</term> and small ranchers in Wyoming‚Äîamong them former cowboys who had built their own herds. Such clashes added to the romantic allure of the ‚ÄúWild West,‚Äù and they seemed to support Frederick Jackson Turner‚Äôs thesis that the closing of the frontier would trigger class conflict in American society because there was now a limited amount of land to settle. Cowboys and trail drives became symbols of that fading era and the national character it had supposedly fostered, an exceptional culture based on <term>meritocracy</term> and rugged individualism.</para>
<para id="fs-idm358357488">Cowboys also became a source of nostalgia for a country rapidly moving from its rural-agrarian roots into an urban-industrial future. By the early twentieth century, their mythic significance had eclipsed their actual role in making the modern United States. To quote the famous western, <emphasis effect="italics">The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</emphasis>, ‚ÄúThis is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.‚Äù The public may have preferred it that way because of the appeal of American ideals of individualism and independence, especially in an age of industrial, urban, and social regimentation during the twentieth century.</para>
