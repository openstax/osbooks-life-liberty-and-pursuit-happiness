<title>II. Exploration (35-40 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm257693376">Distribute Handout A and introduce the following DBQ activity. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Enlightenment or Age of Reason took hold in Western Europe. This intellectual movement asserted that human reason could solve problems, and it spawned new ideas concerning human nature and society, government, and politics. As these ideas spread through the increasingly literate populations of Europe and America, political unrest erupted into revolutions, beginning with the American Revolution in the 1770s. In this activity, students will examine documents from the American, French, Haitian, and Latin American revolutions to address the following prompt: <emphasis effect="bold">To what extent was there a connection between the American Revolution and revolutions in France, Haiti, and Latin America?</emphasis></para>
