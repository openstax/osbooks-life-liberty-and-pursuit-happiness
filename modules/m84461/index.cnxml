<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm225546400">World War II ended in 1945. The United States and the Soviet Union had cooperated to defeat Nazi Germany, but they mistrusted each other. Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator, believed the Americans had waited too long before launching the D-Day invasion of France in 1944, leaving his people to bear the full brunt of the German war machine. It was true that Soviet casualties were more than 20 million, whereas American casualties in all theaters of war were fewer than half a million.</para>
<para id="fs-idm213290848">On the other hand, Harry Truman, Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs vice president, who had become president after Roosevelt‚Äôs death in April 1945, believed Stalin had betrayed a promise made to Roosevelt at the <term>Yalta summit</term> in February 1945. That promise was to permit all the nations of Europe to become independent and self-governing at the war‚Äôs end. Instead, Stalin installed Soviet <term>puppet governments</term> in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, the parts of Europe his armies had recaptured from the Nazis.</para>
<para id="fs-idm660918736">These tensions between the two countries set the stage for the Cold War that came to dominate foreign and domestic policy during the postwar era. The world‚Äôs two superpowers turned from allies into ideological and strategic enemies as they struggled to protect and spread their systems around the world, while at the same time developing arsenals of nuclear weapons that could destroy it. Domestically, the United States emerged from the war as the world‚Äôs unchallenged economic powerhouse and enjoyed great prosperity from pent-up consumer demand and industrial dominance. Americans generally supported preserving the New Deal welfare state and the postwar anti-communist crusade. While millions of white middle-class Americans moved to settle down in the suburbs, African Americans had fought a war against racism abroad and were prepared to challenge it at home.</para>

<title>The Truman Doctrine and the Cold War</title>
<para id="fs-idm637613728">Journalists nicknamed the deteriorating relationship between the two great powers a ‚Äú<term>cold war</term>,‚Äù and the name stuck. In the short run, America possessed the great advantage of being the only possessor of nuclear weapons as a result of the Manhattan Project. It had used two of them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war in the Far East, with destructive power so fearsome it deterred Soviet aggression. But after nearly four years of war, Truman was reluctant to risk a future conflict. Instead, with congressional support, he pledged to keep American forces in Europe to prevent any more Soviet advances. This was the ‚Äú<term>Truman Doctrine</term>,‚Äù a dramatic contrast with the American decision after World War I to withdraw from European affairs (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_02_HTruman"/>). (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84493">Harry S. Truman, ‚ÄúTruman Doctrine‚Äù Address, March 1947</link> Primary Source.)</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm196725552">The National Security Act, passed by Congress in 1947, reorganized the relationship between the military forces and the government. It created the National Security Council (NSC), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the office of Secretary of Defense. The Air Force, previously a branch of the U.S. Army, now became independent, a reflection of its new importance in an era of nuclear weapons. Eventually, NSC-68, a secret memorandum from 1950, was used to authorize large increases in American military strength and aid to its allies, aiming to ensure a high degree of readiness for war against the Soviet Union.</para>
<para id="fs-idm201566816">What made the Soviet Union tick? George Kennan, an American diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow who knew the Soviets as well as anyone in American government, wrote an influential article titled ‚ÄúThe Sources of Soviet Conduct.‚Äù Originally sent from Moscow as a long telegram, it was later published in the journal <emphasis effect="italics">Foreign Affairs</emphasis> under the byline ‚ÄúX‚Äù and impressed nearly all senior American policy makers in Washington, DC. The Soviets, said Kennan, believed capitalism and communism could not coexist and that they would be perpetually at war until one was destroyed. According to Kennan, the Soviets believed communism was destined to dominate the world. They were disciplined and patient, however, and understood ‚Äúthe logic of force.‚Äù Therefore, said Kennan, the United States must be equally patient, keeping watch everywhere to ‚Äúcontain‚Äù the threat.</para>
<para id="fs-idm223970832"><term>Containment</term> became the guiding principle of U.S. anti-Soviet policy, under which the United States deployed military, economic, and cultural resources to halt Soviet expansion. In 1948, the United States gave more than $12 billion to Western Europe to relieve suffering and help rebuild and integrate the economies through the Marshall Plan. The Europeans would thus not turn to communism in their desperation and America would promote mutual prosperity through trade. The Berlin crisis of 1948‚Äì1949 was the policy‚Äôs first great test. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84492">George Kennan (‚ÄúMr. X‚Äù), ‚ÄúSources of Soviet Conduct,‚Äù July 1947</link> Primary Source.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm653242208">Berlin, jointly occupied by the major powers, lay inside Soviet-dominated East Germany, but access roads led to it from the West. In June 1948, Soviet forces cut these roads, hoping the Americans would permit the whole of Berlin to fall into the Soviet sphere rather than risk war. Truman and his advisors, recognizing the symbolic importance of Berlin but reluctant to fire the first shot, responded by having supplies flown into West Berlin, using aircraft that had dropped bombs on Berlin just three years earlier. Grateful Berliners called them the ‚Äúraisin bombers‚Äù in tribute to one of the foods they brought.</para>
<para id="fs-idm232346352">After 11 months, recognizing their plan had failed, the Soviets relented. West Berlin remained part of West Germany, making the first test of containment a success. On the other hand, the United States was powerless to prevent a complete Communist takeover in Czechoslovakia, whose government had shown some elements of independence from Moscow‚Äôs direction. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m84465">The Berlin Airlift</link> Narrative.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm636645888">Alarm about the Czech situation hastened the American decision to begin re-arming West Germany, where an imperfect and incomplete process of ‚Äúde-Nazification‚Äù had taken place. The United States also supervised the creation in 1949 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an alliance of Western nations to forestall Soviet aggression in central Europe (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_02_NATreaty"/>). The U.S. government also continued research on and development of new and more powerful nuclear weapons. Americans were dismayed to learn, in 1949, that the Soviets had successfully tested an atomic bomb of their own, greatly facilitated by information provided by Soviet spies. Europe and much of the world were divided between the world‚Äôs two superpowers and their allies.</para>

<title>Postwar Uncertainty</title>
<para id="fs-idm230653696">The postwar years were politically volatile ones all over the world, due to widespread decolonization. Britain, though allied with the United States during World War II, had been weakened by the conflict and could no longer dominate its remote colonies. The British Empire was shrinking drastically, and this made the Truman Doctrine all the more necessary. In 1947, an economically desperate Britain reluctantly granted India and Pakistan the independence their citizens had sought for years. Britain‚Äôs African colonies gained independence in the 1950s and early 1960s. The United States and the Soviet Union each struggled to win over the former British colonies to their own ideological side of the Cold War. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84485">Who Was Responsible for Starting the Cold War?</link> Point-Counterpoint and <link class="target-chapter" document="m84486">Winston Churchill, ‚ÄúSinews of Peace,‚Äù March 1946</link> Primary Source.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm221267600">Israel came into existence on May 14, 1948, on land that had been a British-controlled <term>mandate</term> since the end of World War I. The Zionist movement, founded in the 1890s by Austro-Hungarian journalist Theodore Herzl, had encouraged European Jews to immigrate to Palestine. There, they would buy land, become farmers, and eventually create a Jewish state. Tens of thousands, indeed, had migrated there and prospered between 1900 and 1945. Widespread sympathy for the Jews, six million of whom had been exterminated in the Nazi Holocaust, prompted the new United Nations to authorize the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. From the very beginning, these two states were at war, with all the neighboring Arab states uniting to threaten Israel‚Äôs survival. President Truman supported Israel, however, and in the ensuing decades, most American politicians, and virtually all the American Jewish population, supported and strengthened it.</para>
<para id="fs-idm208884368">In 1949, a decades-long era of chaos, conquest, and revolution in China ended with the triumph of Mao Zedong, leader of a Communist army. Against him, America had backed Chiang Kai-Shek, the Chinese Nationalist leader, whose defeated forces fled to the offshore island of Taiwan. American anti-communist politicians in Washington, DC, pointed to the growing ‚Äúred‚Äù (Communist) areas of the map as evidence that communism was winning the struggle for the world. Domestically, Truman and the Democrats endured charges that they had ‚Äúlost‚Äù China to communism.</para>

<title>War in Korea</title>
<para id="fs-idm217183664">Korea, one of the many parts of Asia that Japan had conquered in the earlier twentieth century but then lost in 1945, was now partitioned into a pro-Communist North and an anti-Communist South. In June 1950, the Truman administration was taken by surprise when North Korea attacked the South, overpowering its army and forcing the survivors back into a small area of the country‚Äôs southeast, the Pusan perimeter. Truman and his advisors quickly concluded they should apply the containment principle to Asia and procured a resolution of support from the United Nations, which was unanimous because the Soviet representatives were not present in the Security Council during the vote (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_02_KoreaGun"/>). See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84481">Truman Intervenes in Korea</link> Decision Point.)</para>

<para id="fs-idm226075968">An American invasion force led by General Douglas MacArthur thus made a daring counterattack, landing at Inchon, near Seoul on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, on September 15, 1950. At once, this attack turned the tables in the war, forcing the North Koreans into retreat. Rather than simply restore the old boundary, however, MacArthur‚Äôs force advanced deep into North Korea, ultimately approaching the Chinese border. At this point, in October 1950, Mao Zedong sent tens of thousands of Chinese Communist soldiers into the conflict on the side of North Korea. They turned the tide of the war once again, forcing the American forces to fall back in disarray.</para>
<para id="fs-idm201332528">After a brutal winter of hard fighting in Korea, the front lines stabilized around the <term>38th parallel</term>. MacArthur, already a hero of World War II in the Pacific, had burnished his reputation at Inchon. In April 1951, however, he crossed the line in civil-military relations that bars soldiers from dabbling in politics by publicly criticizing one of President Truman‚Äôs strategic decisions not to expand the war against the Chinese. MacArthur was so popular in America, he had come to think the rules no longer applied to him, but they did. Truman fired him with no hesitation, replacing him with the equally competent but less egotistical General Matthew Ridgway. The war dragged on in a stalemate. Only in 1953, after the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was a truce declared between the two Koreas. It has held uneasily ever since.

<title>Prosperity and the Baby Boom</title>
<para id="fs-idm210491168">The late 1940s and early 1950s were paradoxical. They were years of great geopolitical stress, danger, and upheaval, yet they were also a time of prosperity and opportunity for millions of ordinary American citizens. Far more babies were born each year than in the 1930s, resulting in the large ‚Äú<term>baby boom</term>‚Äù generation. Millions of new houses were built to meet a need accumulated over the long years of the Great Depression and the war. Suburbs expanded around every city, creating far better and less-crowded living conditions than ever before. Levittown housing developments were just one example of the planned communities with mass-produced homes across the country that made homeownership within the reach of many, though mostly white families, thanks to cheap loans for returning veterans (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84487">Levittown Videos, 1947‚Äì1957</link> Primary Source). Wages and living standards increased, and more American consumers found they could afford their own homes, cars, refrigerators, air conditioners, and even television sets‚ÄîTV was then a new and exciting technology (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_02_TV"/>). The entire nation breathed a sigh of relief on discovering that peace did not bring a return of depression-era conditions and widespread unemployment. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m84508">The Sound of the Suburbs</link> Lesson.)</para>

<para id="fs-idm218458864">Full employment during the war years had strengthened trade unions, but for patriotic reasons, nearly all industrial workers had cooperated with their employers. Now that the war was over, a rash of strikes for better pay and working conditions broke out. In 1945, Truman expanded presidential power by seizing coal mines, arguing it was in the national interest because coal supplied electricity. He then forced the United Mine Workers to end their strike the following year.</para>
<para id="fs-idm230632528">Although coal miners won their demands, the power of organized labor waned over the next few decades. Republican members of Congress, whose party had triumphed in the 1946 mid-term elections, passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, aiming to curb the power of unions by banning the closed shop, allowing states to protect the right to work outside the union, setting regulations to limit labor strikes and excluding supporters of the Communist Party and other social radicals from their leadership. Truman vetoed the act, but Congress overrode the veto. In 1952, Truman attempted to again seize a key industry and forestall a strike among steelworkers. However, the Supreme Court decided in <emphasis effect="italics">Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</emphasis> (1952) that Truman lacked the constitutional authority to seize private property, and steelworkers won significant concessions.</para>

<title>Joseph McCarthy and the Red Scare</title>
<para id="fs-idm637600960">Fear of communism, not only abroad but at home, was one of the postwar era‚Äôs great obsessions. Ever since the Russian Revolution of 1917, a small and dedicated American Communist Party had aimed to overthrow capitalism and create a Communist America. Briefly popular during the crisis of the Great Depression and again when Stalin was an American ally in World War II, the party shrank during the early Cold War years. Rising politicians like the young California congressman Richard Nixon nevertheless discovered that anti-Communism was a useful issue for gaining visibility. Nixon helped win publicity for the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), whose hearings urged former communists to expose their old comrades in the name of national security, especially in government and Hollywood. In 1947, President Truman issued Executive Order No. 9835, establishing loyalty boards investigating the communist sympathies of 2.5 million federal employees. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m84466">The Postwar Red Scare</link> and the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84467">Cold War Spy Cases</link> Narratives.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm223093056">The most unscrupulous anti-communist was Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-WI), who used fear of communism as a powerful political issue during the early Cold War. He made reckless allegations that the government was riddled with communists and their sympathizers, even including Secretary of State George Marshall. Intimidating all critics by accusing them of being part of a great communist conspiracy, McCarthy finally overplayed his hand in publicly televised hearings by accusing the U.S. Army of knowingly harboring communists among its senior officers (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_02_McCarthCohn"/>). The Senate censured him in December 1954, after which his influence evaporated, but for four years, he had been one of the most important figures in American political life. Although he was correct that the Soviets had spies in the U.S. government, McCarthy created a climate of fear and ruined the lives of innocent people for his own political gain during what became known as the ‚ÄúSecond Red Scare.‚Äù (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84506">McCarthyism DBQ</link> Lesson.)</para>

Klaus Fuchs and other scientists with detailed knowledge of the Manhattan Project were caught passing nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. In 1950, Alger Hiss was prosecuted for perjury before Congress and accused of sharing State Department documents with the Soviets. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were tried for espionage in 1951 and executed two years later. Julius was convicted of running a spy ring associated with selling atomic secrets to the Russians, though the case against Ethel‚Äôs direct involvement was thinner.</para>

<title>From Truman to Eisenhower</title>
<para id="fs-idm229618704">After the 1946 midterm election, in which Republicans won a majority in the House and the Senate, the Democratic President Truman struggled to advance his domestic program, called the Fair Deal in an echo of Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal. For instance, Truman was the first American president to propose a system of universal health care, but the Republican Congress voted it down because they opposed the cost and regulations associated with the government program and called it ‚Äúsocialized medicine.‚Äù Truman did succeed in other areas. He was able to encourage Congress to pass the Employment Act of 1946, committing the government to ensuring full employment. By executive order, he desegregated the American armed forces and commissioned a report on African American civil rights. He thus played an important role in helping advance the early growth of the civil rights movement.</para>
<para id="fs-idm233501712">Truman seemed certain to lose his re-election bid in 1948. The Republicans had an attractive candidate in Thomas Dewey, and Truman‚Äôs own Democratic Party was splintering three ways. Former Vice President Henry Wallace led a Progressive breakaway, advocating a less confrontational approach to the Cold War. Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina senator, led the southern ‚ÄúDixiecrat‚Äù breakaway by opposing any breach in racial segregation. The <emphasis effect="italics">Chicago Daily Tribune</emphasis> was so sure Dewey would win that it prematurely printed its front page with the headline ‚ÄúDewey Defeats Truman.‚Äù One of the most famous photographs in the history of American journalism shows Truman, who had upset the pollsters by winning, holding a copy of this newspaper aloft and grinning broadly (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_02_DeweyTrumn"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm202093824">Four years later, exhausted by Korea and the fierce stresses of the early Cold War, Truman declined to run for another term. Both parties hoped to attract the popular Supreme Allied commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, to be their candidate. He accepted the Republicans‚Äô invitation, defeated Adlai Stevenson in November 1952, and won against the same rival again in 1956.</para>
<para id="fs-idm235483424">Rather than roll back the New Deal, which had greatly increased the size and reach of the federal government since 1933, Eisenhower accepted most of it as a permanent part of the system, in line with his philosophy of ‚ÄúModern Republicanism.‚Äù He worked with Congress to balance the budget but signed bills for the expansion of Social Security and unemployment benefits, a national highway system, federal aid to education, and the creation of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In foreign policy, he recognized that for the foreseeable future, the Cold War was here to stay and that each side‚Äôs possession of nuclear weapons deterred an attack by the other. The two sides‚Äô nuclear arsenals escalated during the 1950s, soon reaching a condition known as ‚Äú<term>mutually assured destruction</term>,‚Äù which carried the ominous acronym MAD and would supposedly prevent a nuclear war.</para>
<para id="fs-idm200951920">At the same time, Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles supported the ‚ÄúNew Look‚Äù foreign policy, which increased reliance on nuclear weapons rather than the more flexible but costly buildup of conventional armed forces. Despite the Cold War consensus about containment, Eisenhower did not send troops when the Vietnamese defeated the French in Vietnam; when mainland China bombed the Taiwanese islands of Quemoy and Matsu; when the British, French, and Egypt fought over the Suez Canal in 1956; or when the Soviets cracked down on Hungary. Instead, Eisenhower assumed financial responsibility for the French war effort in Vietnam and sent hundreds of military advisers there over the next several years.

Martin Luther King Jr., then a spellbinding young preacher in Montgomery, Alabama, led a Montgomery bus boycott that began in December 1955. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a city bus, African Americans refused to ride Montgomery‚Äôs buses unless the company abandoned its policy of forcing them to ride at the back and to give up their seats to whites when the bus was crowded. After a year, the boycott succeeded. King went on to create the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which practiced nonviolent resistance as a tactic, attracting press attention, embarrassing the agents of segregation, and promoting racial integration.

<para id="fs-idm248661824">In 1957, Congress passed the first federal protection of civil rights since Reconstruction and empowered the federal government to protect black voting rights. However, the bill was watered down and did not lead to significant change. In August, black students tried to attend high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, but were blocked by National Guard troops. Over the next few weeks, angry crowds assembled and threatened these students. President Eisenhower decided to send in federal troops to protect the nine black students. In the postwar era, African Americans won some victories in the fight for equality, but many southern whites began a campaign of massive resistance to that goal.</para>

<para id="fs-idm232461952">Thus, the pace of school desegregation across the south remained very slow. White southerners in Congress promised massive resistance to the policy. When it came to the point, however, only one county, Prince Edward County, Virginia, actually closed down its public schools rather than permit them to be desegregated. Other districts, gradually and reluctantly, eventually undertook integration, but widespread discrimination persisted, especially in the South.</para>
<para id="fs-idm255941920">Mexican Americans, like African Americans, suffered from racial discrimination. Under the <emphasis effect="italics">bracero</emphasis> program, inaugurated during the 1940s, Mexicans were permitted to enter the United States temporarily to work, mainly as farm laborers in the western states, but they too were treated by whites as second-class citizens (<link target-id="BRI_APUSH_13_02_Bracero"/>). They were guest workers, and the program was not intended to put them on a path to U.S. citizenship. (See <link class="target-chapter" document="m84473">The Little Rock Nine</link> Narrative.)</para>

<title>The Space Race</title>
<para id="fs-idm243410496">The desegregation of schools was only one aspect of public concern about education in the 1950s. The Soviet Union launched an artificial orbiting satellite, ‚ÄúSputnik,‚Äù in 1957 and ignited the ‚Äú<term>Space Race</term>.‚Äù Most Americans were horrified, understanding that a rocket able to carry a satellite into space could also carry a warhead to the United States. Congress reacted by passing the National Defense Education Act in August 1958, devoting $1 billion of federal funds to education in science, engineering, and technology in the hope of improving the nation‚Äôs scientific talent pool.</para>
<para id="fs-idm235770528">NASA had been created earlier that same year to coordinate programs related to rocketry and space travel. NASA managed to catch up with the Soviet space program in the ensuing years and later triumphed by placing the first person on the moon in 1969. Better space rockets meant better military missiles. NASA programs also stimulated useful technological discoveries in materials, navigation, and computers. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84478">Sputnik and NASA</link> Narrative and the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84484">Was Federal Spending on the Space Race Justified?</link> Point-Counterpoint.)</para>
<para id="fs-idm218623744">Another major initiative, also defense related, of the Eisenhower years was the decision to build the interstate highway system. As a young officer just after World War I, Eisenhower had been part of an Army truck convoy that attempted to cross the United States. Terrible roads meant that the convoy took 62 days, with many breakdowns and 21 injuries to the soldiers, an experience Eisenhower never forgot. He had also been impressed by the high quality of Germany‚Äôs autobahns near the war‚Äôs end. A comprehensive national system across the United States would permit military convoys to move quickly and efficiently. Commerce, the trucking industry, and tourism would benefit too, a belief borne out over the next 35 years while the system was built; it was declared finished in 1992. See <link class="target-chapter" document="m84474">The National Highway Act</link> Narrative and the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84505">Nam Paik, <emphasis effect="italics">Electronic Superhighway</emphasis>, 1995</link> Primary Source.)</para>

<title>New Roles for Women</title>
<para id="fs-idm224620752">American women, especially in the large and growing middle class, were in a paradoxical situation in the 1950s. In one sense, they were the most materially privileged generation of women in world history, wealthier than any predecessors. More had gained college education than ever before, and millions were marrying young, raising their children with advice from Dr. Spock‚Äôs best-selling <emphasis effect="italics">Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care</emphasis> (1946), and enjoying labor-saving domestic devices and modern conveniences like washing machines, toasters, and electric ovens. Affluence meant many middle-class women were driving cars of their own. This <link url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmzlbkhyCJ4">1950s advertisement for Ford automobiles</link> persuaded women to become a ‚Äútwo Ford family.‚Äù At the same time, however, some suffered various forms of depression and anxiety, seeking counseling, often medicating themselves, and feeling a lack of purpose in their lives.</para>
<para id="fs-idm661961760">This situation was noticed by Betty Friedan, a popular journalist in the 1950s whose book <emphasis effect="italics">The Feminine Mystique</emphasis>, published in 1963, helped ignite the new feminist movement. Its principal claim was that in America in the 1950s, women lacked fulfilling careers of their own, and material abundance was no substitute. (See the <link class="target-chapter" document="m84480">Dr. Benjamin Spock and the Baby Boom</link> Narrative.) A feminist movement emerged in the 1960s and 1970s seeking greater equality. In the postwar period, however, not all women shared the same experiences. Millions of working-class and poor women of all races continued to work in factories, retail, domestic, or offices as they had before and during the war. Whether married or single, these women generally did not share in the postwar affluence enjoyed by middle-class, mostly white, women who were in the vanguard of the feminist movement for equal rights for women.</para>
<para id="fs-idm248289424">By 1960, the United States was, without question, in a superior position to its great rival the Soviet Union‚Äîricher, stronger, healthier, better fed, much freer, and much more powerful. Nevertheless Eisenhower, in his farewell address, warned against the dangers of an overdeveloped ‚Äúmilitary-industrial complex,‚Äù in which American traditions of democracy, decentralization, and civilian control would be swallowed up by the demands of the defense industry and a large, governmental national security apparatus. He had no easy remedies to offer and remained acutely aware that the Cold War continued to threaten the future of the world.</para>
