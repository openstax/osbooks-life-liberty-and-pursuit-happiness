<title>I. Warm-Up Activity (5‚Äì10 min)</title>
<para id="fs-idm396977408">Write this question on the board: If a U.S. president does the following actions, should she or he be formally accused, tried, and removed from office if found guilty in a fair trial? Then list actions 1‚Äì5 below the question and have students write on a sheet of paper their yes or no answer to each. Students should be prepared to explain their reasoning. After students have individually voted ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù for each action, then call for a show of hands for each action to tally the student results. Start with the action that received the most ‚Äúyes‚Äù votes and ask a few student volunteers to justify their response by referring to a specific part of the U.S. Constitution. Explain that ‚Äúimpeach‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúremove from office.‚Äù Impeach means to formally accuse and bring to trial. According to the U.S. Constitution, if a president is impeached by a majority vote of the House of Representatives and found guilty by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, the punishment is removal from office. Wait until the end of the lesson to give the historical examples.</para>
<list id="fs-idm394167664" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>The president receives gifts from a foreign power without the approval of Congress. (Historical example: hypothetical scenario from the Philadelphia Convention debates)</item>
<item>The president orders detention of a racial or ethnic group for national security reasons. (Historical example: Franklin D. Roosevelt in World War II)</item>
<item>The president refuses to enforce laws passed by Congress. (Historical example: Woodrow Wilson refusing to abide by a law governing the removal of postmasters)</item>
<item>The president participates in a conspiracy to conceal evidence that his associates have committed a burglary. (Historical example: Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal)</item>
<item>In a sexual harassment lawsuit, the president lies under oath. (Historical example: Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones/Monica Lewinski proceedings)</item>

<para id="fs-idm394553744">Distribute the resource packet for the lesson and assign the background and primary source readings to students. Assign the readings as best fits your teaching situation (e.g., small groups, jigsaw). Using <emphasis effect="bold">Handout A: What were the Founders‚Äô Intentions Regarding Impeachment?</emphasis>, assign the following speaking parts: Narrator, George Washington, George Mason, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, Elbridge Gerry, and Alexander Hamilton, and give them a few moments to preview their parts. Then present the role play.
